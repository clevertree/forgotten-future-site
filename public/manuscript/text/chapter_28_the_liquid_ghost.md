# Chapter 28: Maya

Maya materialized as a Water Vessel, her form shaped by Synodic technology that harnesses the element of Water. The Builder units responded to her administrative frequency immediately. They recognized her as a primary aetheric presence and began to follow her instructions.

Drexler attempted to negotiate a settlement. Maya rejected his offer. She began to deactivate the laboratory systems. She opened the storage vats and reversed the operational protocols.

Drexler triggered a containment protocol. The lab module was disconnected from the main structure and ejected over a cliff. The module hit the desert floor and was destroyed by a high-temperature purge. Telemetry data confirmed complete thermal incineration. I transferred my data signature into the forest's root network. I reconstructed my physical form inside a tree by matching the root system's frequency.

A low-frequency acoustic signal moved through the ground. Local sensors recorded it as a high-amplitude spike. The Gorgon units stopped their work. Thousands of industrial units moved out of the Hive. Striders and Monoliths moved toward the city perimeter and formed a circular formation. The lights in the Hive decreased in intensity.
