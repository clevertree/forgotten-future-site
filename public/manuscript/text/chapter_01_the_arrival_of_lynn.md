# Chapter 1: The Arrival of Lynn

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The morning was a set of small noises that did not belong to me: the TV muttering about "anomalies," a woman two houses down packing a single suitcase with methodical hands, a child's toy abandoned in the gutter. The sky was ordinary. The news read like weather.

When the monoliths came into view they fit into the horizon the way a bad fact fits into a life—cleanly, without arguing. From the street corner I saw them: four-legged silhouettes against the low sun, their joints too many and their shadow too still. People called them "Tripods" because language had to move, but the machines had a lean that suggested neither animal nor machine wholly. The city began to thin.

I did not panic. I noted the cadence of it. Evacuation drones moved like unhurried insects. Soldiers checked identity tags the way men check for scabs in the morning: with a professional touch and an implicit question. My own hands folded around nothing.

They came to my door with a clipboard. They were loud enough to bring the neighborhood out into the street and small enough to be contained by the perimeter they set. A sergeant explained that we were being taken in for debriefing—standard procedure, he said. The word fell into my mouth and sat there like a stone.

She arrived wrapped in a coat that made the sergeant step back as if the air around her had changed. There were no uniforms beneath her—that detail, the absence, is how I recall her authority. She looked at me as if she were reading a short, troublesome note. "Lem," she said. The name hit me like a report: factual, not new, not old.

She said that she knew me, that I had a place to fill. I answered with what I had: confusion, the small resistance of a man who still remembers his own body. She reached for my wrist and there was a pressure like a hand on a violin string. An activation attempt, she called it later. I felt something move at the base of my skull—an imposition that settled like a tide and asked me to carry on in a way that was not mine. I resisted; it was an animal thing, reflex and refusal.

When she saw that I would not comply she did something precise: she struck me. The blow did not have a theatricality to it—no shouted warning, no wasted motion—only a clean, efficient closure. My world narrowed to the sound of my own breath.

They carried me as if I were a case to be catalogued. The last sensory impression before the darkness was the smell of ozone, like electricity after rain.

In that place that was not a room and not a dream, she waited.

It was a mirror with no surface. There were coordinates that made sense only when you had a reason to be somewhere else. She told me my nature simply: I was not what I thought. She called it "Wood," used the word as if it were a label and an explanation both. I listened to the explanation as one listens to a document read aloud—important, but not yet mine.

A tautness moved through my limbs; the chamber kept its coordinates and made no response.

There was an aperture, and beyond it: a convoy, a rocket smoke, the slow sky of something breaking.

## Concept
Lem's quiet life fractures when the Moon's machines arrive and Lynn claims him; the scene establishes his passive observer state and the first, violent loss of bodily agency.

## Outline
- News reports are a background hum; the Moon's anomalies feel distant.
- Monoliths become visible on the horizon; evacuations begin.
- Military arrives at Lem's house; he watches, detached.
- Lynn appears, exercises authority, and claims prior ties to Lem.
- She attempts to activate his Aether-Drive; Lem resists and is struck unconscious.
- Lem is pulled into an Aether-space in which Lynn explains his nature.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain Lem's detached but observant voice. 
- Avoid adding backstory beyond what appears in the plot beats.
- Introduce more of the "mirror doorway" imagery later if requested.
