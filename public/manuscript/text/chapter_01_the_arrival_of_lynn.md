# Chapter 1: The Arrival of Lynn

The contents of this broadcast represent a full record of my memory, starting from the first moment I can remember and ending with the transmission of this packet. I have kept my own opinions out of the record; I want to provide a factual account. I only hope that these mistakes aren't repeated.

I recall a childhood defined by repeatable routines: scheduled meals, school rolls, and the structure of institutional care. I was an orphan; my days were governed by timetables rather than family memory. Those steady facts are where I look when I try to find a before.

The morning was a sequence of ordinary household sounds and news bulletins. The leaks about Base Alpha had already begun to change the shape of the day: radios left on, curtains drawn, neighbors adjusting their timing. The sky was ordinary; the news had ceased to be neutral.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I did not panic. I observed. The leak had shifted my attention toward small anomalies—radios left on, curtains drawn, people pausing as if awaiting instruction. Evacuation drones flew overhead and soldiers checked identity tags with quick, professional movements. My hands were empty.

I stood on the curb watching the monoliths on the horizon when a military convoy consisting of three transport trucks and a command vehicle turned into the street. The soldiers carried rifles and moved with a practiced, administrative efficiency. A sergeant stepped from the lead vehicle. He did not look at me directly but checked a tablet interface before stating that I was being taken for debriefing. I did not move.

Lynn stepped from the command vehicle. She did not wear a uniform, yet the sergeant immediately yielded his position. She approached me with a gait that suggested a high degree of technical authority. Her eyes lacked the shared panic of the neighborhood; her posture was perfectly still. She looked at me for several seconds before speaking. "Lem," she said. The name registered as a familiar frequency, though I found no corresponding memory to account for it.

She said that she knew me and that I had a job to do. I told her I was confused, but she reached for my wrist and a pressure localized there. I did not know then that she was attempting to initialize an Aether-Drive connection; I only recorded the weight at the base of my skull that made me pull away.

When she saw that I wouldn't comply, she struck me once. She did not speak before or after the blow. My world went dark as the soldiers carried me toward the transport. I passed out.

I entered Aether-space for the first time. Though I didn't have a name for the coordinate then, I recognize it now. It was not a physical room and it was not a dream. Lynn was waiting there.

She told me I was not human. She explained that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she required my cooperation. I accepted the statement as fact.

Then the connection severed and I snapped back into my own body. I found myself on the floor of my living room without any control over my limbs. I stood up without a corresponding command from my own will and walked out the front door toward the waiting trucks. I could feel a foreign presence at the base of my brain, like a set of strings pulling at my muscles. I was a passenger.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

We arrived at a military base an hour later, where a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.
