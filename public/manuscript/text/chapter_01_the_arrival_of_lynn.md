# Chapter 1: The Arrival of Lynn

The contents of this broadcast represent a full record of my memory, starting from the first moment I can remember and ending with the transmission of this packet. I have kept my own opinions out of the record; I want to provide a factual account. I only hope that these mistakes aren't repeated. 

I don't remember being a child. My memory starts suddenly, during a mundane suburban afternoon that felt much like the days before the invasion. I recall the smell of damp concrete and the noise of a lawnmower in a neighbor's yard. I don't know why I can't look back any further, but this is the start of everything that follows.

The morning was a set of small noises that did not belong to me: the TV muttering about "anomalies," a woman two houses down packing a single suitcase, a child's toy left in the gutter. The sky was ordinary. The news was routine.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: very tall, thin apes silhouetted against the low sun. Their forearms reached the ground, serving as a second pair of legs. An oversized head reared down at the pavement before them. They moved on all fours with a heavy loping gait. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I did not panic, but instead watched it happen as evacuation drones flew overhead and soldiers checked identity tags with quick, professional movements. My own hands were empty.

They came to my door with a clipboard, making enough noise to bring the neighborhood out into the street. A sergeant told me we were being taken in for debriefing as part of a standard procedure, but I didn't say anything.

She was wearing a coat, and when the sergeant saw her, he stepped back. She didn't have a uniform, and she looked at me for a long time before she finally spoke my name. "Lem," she said, and although it sounded familiar, I didn't know why.

She said that she knew me and that I had a job to do. I told her I was confused, but she reassured me that all I had to do was cooperate and remain completely still during the "Inception" procedure. She reached for my wrist and I felt a pressure, followed by an unsettling weight at the base of my skull that made me pull away.

When she saw that I wouldn't cooperate, she hit me without saying anything first. My world went dark as they carried me away. I passed out.

I entered Aether-space for the first time, and though I didn't know the name for it then, I recognize it now. It was not a room and it was not a dream, but Lynn was waiting there.

She told me I was not human, explaining that I was the only Wood Vessel in existence and that she needed my help. I believed her.

Then she was gone and I snapped back into my own body, finding myself on the floor of my living room without any control over my limbs. I stood up without wanting to and walked out the front door toward the military trucks waiting in the street. I could feel Lynn's presence in the back of my head, like a set of strings pulling at my muscles.

The monoliths were close now, their long shadows stretching over the rooftops as I sat in the back of a transport vehicle. I watched them through the rear window as we drove away, observing the terrifying grace with which they loped over the suburbs.

We arrived at a military base an hour later, where a massive ship sat on the runway reflecting the setting sun. Lynn was there, and although she didn't say anything, she walked with me all the way to the boarding ramp. Once I was inside, she stayed on the ground and watched as the doors closed, leaving me a passenger in my own skin.
