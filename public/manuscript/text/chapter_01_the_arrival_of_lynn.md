# Chapter 1: The Arrival of Lynn

The contents of this broadcast represent a full record of my memory, starting from the first moment I can remember and ending with the transmission of this packet. I have kept my own opinions out of the record; I want to provide a factual account for your own interpretation. I only hope that these mistakes aren't repeated. 

I don't remember being a child. My memory starts suddenly, during a mundane suburban afternoon that felt much like the days before the invasion. I recall the smell of damp concrete and the noise of a lawnmower in a neighbor's yard. I don't know why I can't look back any further, but this is the start of everything that follows.

The morning was a set of small noises that did not belong to me: the TV muttering about "anomalies," a woman two houses down packing a single suitcase, a child's toy left in the gutter. The sky was ordinary. The news was routine.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: four-legged silhouettes against the low sun. They had too many joints and they didn't move. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I did not panic. I watched it happen. Evacuation drones flew overhead. Soldiers checked identity tags. They were quick and professional. My own hands were empty.

They came to my door with a clipboard. They were loud enough to bring the neighborhood out into the street. A sergeant said we were being taken in for debriefing. He said it was standard procedure. I didn't say anything.

She was wearing a coat. When the sergeant saw her, he stepped back. She didn't have a uniform. She looked at me for a long time. "Lem," she said. It sounded familiar, but I didn't know why.

She said that she knew me and that I had a job to do. I told her I was confused. She reached for my wrist and I felt a pressure. She called it an activation attempt later. I felt a weight at the base of my skull. I didn't want it there. I pulled away.

When she saw that I wouldn't cooperate, she hit me. She didn't say anything first. My world went dark.

They carried me away. I smelled ozone before I passed out.

In that place that was not a room and not a dream, she waited.

It was a mirror. There were coordinates that only made sense if you were somewhere else. She told me the truth: I was not what I thought I was. She called me "Wood." I listened to her.

I felt a tightness in my limbs. The chamber didn't move.

There was an opening, and beyond it: a convoy, a rocket launch, and the sky breaking.
