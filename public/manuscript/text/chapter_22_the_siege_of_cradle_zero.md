# Chapter 22: The Siege of Cradle Zero

**Title:** The Siege of Cradle Zero
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We assembled machines like people prepare for winter—anticipatory and precise. Wood frames clasped metal plates; hybrid forms that could move like living things and take a hit like the old engines.

We deployed an Aetheric Buoy to create a local disruption net; nearby hostile units convulsed and slowed as their actions grew erratic. The Monoliths answered with shards and thorns and the sand smelled of burned circuits.

The attacks began with a cadence of ruin. The enemy response was older and hotter than we expected. Cradle Zero's defenses held in places, failed in others. The campaign reduced large sections of land to a map of holes.

Strategy became workaday: rotate machines, mend what breaks, move the wounded out. It was no glorified siege; it was maintenance under fire.

## Revision Notes
- Keep focus on logistic labor rather than heroism.
- Show the toll through lists of work rather than emotive description.
- Retain Lem's dry observation.
