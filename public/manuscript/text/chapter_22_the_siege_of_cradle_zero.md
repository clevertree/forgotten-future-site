# Chapter 22: The Siege of Cradle Zero

**Title:** The Siege of Cradle Zero
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We built new machinery. We used wood frames to support metal plating. These units were flexible and could withstand direct impacts.

We activated an Aetheric Buoy. The resulting disruption net caused hostile units to malfunction. Their movements became irregular. The Monoliths fired metal projectiles. The air smelled of ozone and burned components.

The offensive continued. The enemy used high-energy weapons. Some defense sections near Cradle Zero remained functional, while others were destroyed. The ground in the area was covered with craters.

We established a routine for the conflict. We rotated the machines and repaired the damage. We transported injured personnel to the rear. We focused on maintaining the equipment while under attack.

## Revision Notes
- Keep focus on logistic labor rather than heroism.
- Show the toll through lists of work rather than emotive description.
- Retain Lem's dry observation.
