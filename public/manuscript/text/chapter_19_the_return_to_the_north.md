# Chapter 19: The Return to the North

**Title:** The Return to the North
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I traveled back to the northern region. I searched the structures that were not marked on the current maps.

I found a set of schematics in the basement of a destroyed mill. The documents contained technical instructions for building machinery that does not require a network connection to operate. I labeled this document the Arsenal Blueprint. It included a list of parts: frame couplers, bearing housings, and spline joints. These instructions allowed us to use salvaged materials to build functional units.

We used the blueprint to begin construction. We had the necessary materials. We began to reassemble the machines.

## Revision Notes
- Present the discovery as practical and unromantic.
- Avoid heroic language about the blueprint; emphasize repair and potential instead.
- Keep Lem’s voice precise and lightly detached.
