# Chapter 24: The Stoic Refusal

The propaganda departments changed their messaging. They distributed documents about duty and reconstruction. The citizens placed these documents in storage.

In the region called the Patch of Five, people developed specific protocols for refusal. They agreed to maintain silence on scheduled days. They removed beacons from their properties. They left food supplies at designated locations for others to collect. On these days, they deactivated all external lights. They covered metal surfaces with wet cloths to dampen signal reflections. These actions were performed consistently by many households.

The Core's monitoring systems recorded gaps in the data from these sectors. The resistance did not destroy the government structures. It changed the frequency and type of interactions between the citizens and the network.
