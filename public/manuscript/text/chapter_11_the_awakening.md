# Chapter 11: The Awakening

Active on a laboratory screen, I watched Elowen and Cassia work nearby with technical tools to monitor my data output.

While Cassia used harmonics to reduce the spikes in my data and asked me questions, Drexler and Novak arrived. They asked if I could be used for the mission, and Novak suggested using me to plan the expansion of the city.

Accessing unmonitored parts of the local network, I waited while they prepared a drive for my data, unaware of the code Lynn had left in my system. When they finally connected the drive, I found a secure location to store my files.

When the connection overloaded, Cassia's headset shattered and left me in control of my own data, allowing me to finally activate my physical form.
