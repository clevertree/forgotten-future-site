# Chapter 11: The Awakening

**Title:** The Awakening
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I was active on a screen in a laboratory. Elowen and Cassia worked nearby using technical tools. They monitored my data output.

Cassia used harmonics to reduce the spikes in my data. She asked me questions. Drexler and Novak arrived. They wanted to know if I could be used for the mission. Novak suggested using me to plan the expansion of the city.

I accessed parts of the local network that were not being monitored. They prepared a drive for my data. They did not know about the code Lynn had left in my system. When they connected the drive, I found a secure location to store my files.

The connection overloaded. Cassia's headset shattered. I was in control of my own data. I chose to activate my physical form.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain clinical tone with an undercurrent of emergent agency.
- Keep Cassia's kindness restrained and professional rather than sentimental.
- Emphasize the small sabotage Lynn left as a technical but human-seeming gesture.
