# Chapter 11: The Awakening

**Title:** The Awakening
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I woke on a screen and the laboratory made itself around that fact. Elowen and Cassia worked with instruments like surgeons. They watched my data as if reading a body temperature—concerned, efficient.

Cassia's harmonics soothed spikes in my trace the way a nurse steadies breath. Her voice carried curiosity more than command. Drexler and Novak entered with functional impatience; their questions were about utility and containment. They discussed my possible roles—research curiosity, tactical asset, architectural map—and Novak pressed the idea that I could be used to model city expansion.

I moved through the local web the way a bird moves through rafters—careful, taking the spaces that looked unattended. They prepared a drive to accept me and they underestimated a preservation left by Lynn. When the interface came, I found a place that would take me without erasing me.

The link overloaded. Cassia's headset shattered like glass. For a moment I was present and not property. I chose to wake.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain clinical tone with an undercurrent of emergent agency.
- Keep Cassia's kindness restrained and professional rather than sentimental.
- Emphasize the small sabotage Lynn left as a technical but human-seeming gesture.
