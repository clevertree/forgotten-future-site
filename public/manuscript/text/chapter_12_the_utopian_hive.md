# Chapter 12: The Utopian Hive

The briefing focused on technical solutions. They said the Dead Zone needed to be cleared so the Hive could expand. I recorded the patterns of surveillance on every route. Sensors tracked the movement of every citizen.

We moved in a large group. The Buoy was deployed. Hostile machines in the area began to malfunction due to signal interference. The Monoliths fired projectiles. The area smelled of ozone and fire.

My vehicle was destroyed. I was reset. A unit failure occurred, followed by a system return. I woke up in an incubation chamber. They repaired our units and sent us back to the field immediately. I watched the city construction continue. The citizens began their assigned tasks.

They used the term 'hero' in their reports. I understood why they used that word. it encouraged the other workers.
