# Chapter 18: The Long Exile

**Title:** The Long Exile
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Time thins when there are no orders. I measured days by the way snow crusted and thawed on the same branch. Rahu's influence burned in distant patterns—fires visible at the horizon that belonged to someone else's war. I logged the smoke lines and recorded coordinates; the notebook would become a map if anyone ever requested it.

I learned to be small there. I watched the spread of the Fire Cities in notes rather than outrage, seeing how smoke drew lines on the map like a new coastline. My work became observation and preservation: a list of broken machines, a record of which villages still kept their doors shut.

I kept steady. I measured days by the way snow crusted and thawed on the same branch. The world could change; I could not un-know what I had seen.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain quiet endurance rather than dramatic exile rhetoric.
- Use sparse details (tracks, smoke) to show the spread of the Fire Cities.
- Keep Lem's tone pragmatic and observational.
