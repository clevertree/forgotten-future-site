# Chapter 18: The Long Exile

With no orders, I recorded local weather patterns, watching the snow accumulate and melt on a single branch while observing fire patterns on the horizon and recording the coordinates of smoke lines in my log.

I stayed in one location to continue my observations and kept the data I had gathered.
