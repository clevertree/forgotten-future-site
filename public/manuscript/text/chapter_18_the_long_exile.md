# Chapter 18: The Long Exile

I had no orders. I recorded the local weather patterns. I watched the snow accumulate and melt on a single branch. I observed fire patterns on the horizon. I recorded the coordinates of the smoke lines in my log.

I remained in the area and avoided detection. I monitored the expansion of the Fire Cities. I noted the locations of new smoke columns. My records included a list of non-functional machinery and a log of which villages remained occupied.

I stayed in one location. I continued my observations. I kept the data I had gathered.
