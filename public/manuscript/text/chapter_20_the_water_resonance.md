# Chapter 20: The Water Resonance

**Title:** The Water Resonance
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Arlo's village smelled of peat and drying fish. He had a way of moving with machines as if they were an extension of the arm, not a rival mind. He listened to the river the way a man listens to a clock.

The village kept silence against the net. There was nothing in the air that the Core could read—no ping, no beacon. I realized then that silence could be a design choice as much as a deficiency.

Arlo taught me to listen to small things: how water carries a note that tells you when a machine is tired; how a membrane of moss can deaden a transmission. He demonstrated a simple test: we strung a wet membrane across a local repeater and the beacon reading went quiet; the tablet showed a measurable drop in signal strength in the membrane's shadow. He taught me that our craft could be water-guided as much as wire-guided.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the lesson practical and sensory: water as a masking medium.
- Show Arlo as a technician with local knowledge, not a symbol.
- Maintain Lem's observational restraint.
