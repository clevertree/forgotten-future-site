# Chapter 10: Disintegration

Rahu accessed the data in my memory. The information about the Moon's destruction contradicted the official records.

Drexler's monitoring system detected the data conflict. It started a sanitizing protocol. The energy inside Rahu increased until it destroyed his frame. There was a surge of heat and then his signal was gone.

I was offline. My data was stored as a file in the system.
