# Chapter 10: Disintegration

**Title:** Disintegration
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Rahu moved through my memory like a hammer through glass—strong, precise, and finally broken by what it found. The raw footage of the Moon's fracture sat in the banks and it did what forbidden things do: it made established stories look like lies.

The response was immediate. Drexler's monitoring detected a feedback loop and an authorization burst traced to the Core's control net; a sanitizing action followed. The Fire within Rahu answered its own call and became its own executioner. There was a heat and then a nothingness that had edges.

My shell did not survive. The blow that consumed Rahu shredded the hull and my body came apart into the necessary pieces the technicians prefer. They collected what was left as if cataloguing a machine that had worn past its intended life.

I drifted again, less in fragments this time and more as an archive entry waiting to be revisited.

## Revision Notes
- Keep emotion thin; emphasize the sanitizing logic of the Core.
- Present Rahu's death as a policy outcome rather than drama.
