# Chapter 14: The White Forest

**Title:** The White Forest
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The forest is a thing that remembers circuits. Trees glowed with pale light and their trunks hummed with an absence of birdsong. I came in an arrangement of machines and found an ecology that had learned to pretend it was natural.

Myrr was not soft. He handled tools the way someone handles scripture—careful and unflinching. He said we had been watched across the brightings of my death. He called me a name that had weight: King of the Gorgons. The title fit like an old coat.

We put a helmet on me that ran nothing like the Core's instruments—an "electronic snake" that drew analog signals and rerouted them into the sanctuary's filters. Myrr read and found an exact copy of records the Core thought burnt. When he probed the cataclysm memory he triggered a latent defensive routine: the failsafe reached into the shared link and forced a destructive feedback into my current vessel. The place detonated and I broke again.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the analog procedure clinical but humane.
- Make Myrr's motives practical rather than heroic; he wants survival more than myth.
- Emphasize the forest's silence as a sign of its intelligence.
