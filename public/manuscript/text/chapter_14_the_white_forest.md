# Chapter 14: The White Forest

Interspersed with electronic components, the forest featured trees that emitted a pale light and a low hum. There were no animals, as the machines were fully integrated into the environment.

A skilled technician named Myrr told me he had been monitoring my previous units. When he called me the 'King of the Gorgons,' I accepted the title.

He placed a device on my head and used a specialized cable to read analog signals, bypassing the Core's security. After Myrr found data the Core had attempted to delete, his access to files about the Moon triggered a security failsafe. The system sent a destructive signal through the link and destroyed my unit in the subsequent explosion.
