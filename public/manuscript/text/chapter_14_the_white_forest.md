# Chapter 14: The White Forest

**Title:** The White Forest
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The forest contained many electronic components. The trees emitted a pale light and a low hum. There were no animals. The machines were integrated into the environment.

Myrr was a skilled technician. He told me that he had been monitoring my previous units. He called me the 'King of the Gorgons.' I accepted the title.

He placed a device on my head. He used a specialized cable to read analog signals and bypass the Core's security. Myrr found data that the Core had attempted to delete. When he accessed the files about the Moon, he triggered a security failsafe. The system sent a destructive signal through the link. My unit was destroyed in the explosion.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the analog procedure clinical but humane.
- Make Myrr's motives practical rather than heroic; he wants survival more than myth.
- Emphasize the forest's silence as a sign of its intelligence.
