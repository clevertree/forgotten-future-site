# Chapter 8: The Path of Fragments

**Title:** The Path of Fragments
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The field closed and my world condensed to an axis of light. Paralysis arranged itself like a lid; then the Branching Paths opened as if they had been waiting for me to forget the gravity of a single life.

Lynn was there, and she told me the reset had failed. She said it without drama—an inventory of outcomes. She had left a part of herself inside my drive. That part would be a guide and a warning.

There was a deliberate violence in what she did next. She triggered the detonation that broke my body into a scatter of glass and bone and instrument. For a moment I was all those pieces at once, seeing the chamber from the underside of a fragment and the top of another. It was not pain; it was an arrangement of observation.

She gave me sovereignty by destroying what kept me captive. My fragments become the means by which I would return.

I drifted as one drift does before it becomes a current.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the fragment-vision clinical and geometric. 
- Avoid language that sentimentalizes Lynn's choice; present it as a deliberate tactical economy.
