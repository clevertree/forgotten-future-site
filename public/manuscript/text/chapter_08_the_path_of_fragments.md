# Chapter 8: The Path of Fragments

The containment field activated around me. I could not move. I saw a bright light in the center of my vision. Then the Branching Paths appeared in my display. These were multiple data streams showing different outcomes. I was no longer restricted to a single timeline.

Lynn appeared in the system. She said that the reset had failed. She had uploaded a part of her code into my internal drive. She said this code was for my protection and to help me navigate.

Lynn caused an explosion inside my frame. My body broke into many pieces. I was made of glass, metal, and organic material. For a moment, I could see the chamber from many points at once. Each fragment of my body sent its own data. This was not painful. I was simply observing the room from multiple locations.

She destroyed my physical form so that the containment field would not work. I was no longer a single object to be held. My fragments were the only way for me to return.

I moved through the vacuum. I was a cloud of debris.
