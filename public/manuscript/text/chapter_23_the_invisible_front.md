# Chapter 23: The Invisible Front

We advanced toward Cradle Zero. We moved in a coordinated formation. We used all available air assets.

Rahu intercepted the fleet. He did not engage in direct combat initially. He redirected local energy fields to disable our systems. Several ships lost power. The technical logs showed that our batteries failed in a pre-programmed sequence. Command relays stop functioning in specific sectors. Our formation broke apart.

The mission failure was the result of multiple system errors across the entire fleet. We withdrew from the area. We had fewer functional machines. I recorded the names of the missing personnel on the cockpit panels.
