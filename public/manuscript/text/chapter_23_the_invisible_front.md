# Chapter 23: The Invisible Front

**Title:** The Invisible Front
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We made for Cradle Zero in a movement that felt like a net being tightened. The plan was fast and desperate; the fleet should have been enough.

Rahu's intervention was not cinematic. It was a reassignment of force—small cuts that left the fleet no better than driftwood. Machines failed in patterns that suggested a mind auditing our moves; batteries that had been reliable dropped out in the same sequence, command relays went silent in repeated places, and we lost cohesion.

The mission unraveled not because of one failure but because the whole was being questioned in every line of attack. We retreated with fewer machines, more empty racks, and missing names taped to panels—evidence of the attrition.

## Revision Notes
- Emphasize the procedural nature of Rahu's dismantling—the precision of attrition.
- Avoid melodrama; keep the description pragmatic.
- Show the human cost indirectly—empty racks, missing names.
