# Chapter 13: The Northern Trial

**Title:** The Northern Trial
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We flew north. The temperature was low. The people in the villages were suspicious of us. They only valued tools that were useful for survival.

Arlo was a boy who worked on electronics in secret. He watched the machines closely. The Tripods passed the village and did not attack. They were moving toward a different destination.

A soldier fired a weapon. The machine returned fire and killed him. Drexler gave an order to find everyone involved. 

We found a pilot who had ejected from his ship. He was injured and afraid. I received an order to complete the mission and eliminate the pilot. I hesitated. A high-authority signal from the Core's network hit my link. The signal triggered a destructive sequence and destroyed my unit.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the incident blunt and immediate.
- Focus on Lem's internal conflict without melodrama.
- Allow Arlo to be a quiet human counterpoint rather than a plot device.
