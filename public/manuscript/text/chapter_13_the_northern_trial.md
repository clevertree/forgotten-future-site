# Chapter 13: The Northern Trial

**Title:** The Northern Trial
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We flew north into a cold that asked for fewer words. The villages kept their fires small and their suspicion large. I watched faces that measured tools by usefulness and suspicion by history.

Arlo was a boy who soldered in secret. He had the habit of looking at machines the way someone looks at a forbidden book—curious and guilty. The Tripods passed and did not touch the village; they were following a path that had nothing to do with us.

A soldier fired. The machine answered in a way that taught us nothing about mercy. Drexler's voice arrived as a policy, and the order to hunt followed like a script.

We found a pilot ejected from the last hull and he was human in the way every living thing is: afraid and small. The command came through: complete the mission. Hesitation cost me. A high-authority signal—later traced to an authorization burst within the Core's network—hit my link and detonated what was still mine.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the incident blunt and immediate.
- Focus on Lem's internal conflict without melodrama.
- Allow Arlo to be a quiet human counterpoint rather than a plot device.
