# Chapter 13: The Northern Trial

We flew north while the temperature dropped, finding the people in the villages suspicious of us as they only valued tools useful for survival.

A boy named Arlo worked on electronics in secret and watched the machines closely, though the Tripods passed the village without attacking as they moved toward a different destination.

A soldier fired a weapon. The machine returned fire. The soldier was killed. Drexler gave an order to locate the survivors.

We found a pilot in the ash. His suit was torn. He did not move. Upon receiving an order to eliminate the pilot, I did not immediately trigger the weapon. Then, a high-authority signal from the Core's network overrode my motor functions. I watched my own arm raise the rifle. My unit was destroyed in the subsequent discharge.
