# Chapter 6: The Sacrifice

**Title:** The Sacrifice
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The fire was large and occupied the space in front of us. Rahu moved across the ground. The air was hot. My instruments recorded multiple errors. We were standing near the edge of the heat. The pilots were giving disorganized orders on the radio.

The bike fleet moved into the canyons. They were trying to avoid the plasma. The ground forces could not advance. Large sparks appeared on the cliffs. They were spheres of plasma. They moved across the valley and targeted the fleet from above. The Gorgon pilots sent distress signals. The formation broke apart.

The ship *Hermes* flew through the debris field and cleared a corridor. The plasma spheres reacted to the ship. Some hit the ground and caused electrical discharges in the gullies. Others hit the *Hermes*. The *Hermes* fired its batteries. There was a collision. Rahu's core and the *Hermes* were both destroyed. I saw heat and smoke. Then the area was quiet.

Iris Novak's voice came over the general comms. I couldn't see her, but her voice was steady. She told everyone to calm down. She said that Tor had simplified the battlefield by clearing the path. She explained that the sacrifice had been necessary to save the mission. She took command then, ordering us all forward. We moved toward the objective. The ground under our route was unstable. It shifted as we drove over it.

We entered the pyramid. The air was stable inside. The noise of the battle outside died away, leaving us in a heavy silence. Novak looked at the massive, sealed doors ahead of us. We were inside, but the mission was far from over.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the action compressed and immediate.
- Emphasize Lem's observational distance when describing Tor's sacrifice and later altered state.
- Avoid adding speculative metaphysics; show only what Lem can observe.
