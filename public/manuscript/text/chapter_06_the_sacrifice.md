# Chapter 6: The Sacrifice

Rahu stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position, he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, sending an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. The air was hot, causing my instruments to record multiple errors while we stood near the edge of the heat. On the radio, pilots gave disorganized orders.

Trying to avoid the plasma, the bike fleet moved into the canyons while ground forces remained trapped on the open plain. We were completely exposed, with no cover against the mysterious spheres arcing down from the mountain peak. As the plasma targeted us from above, the situation became a kill zone where any strike meant total destruction. It was a moment of absolute desperation.

The ship *Hermes* flew through the debris field and cleared a corridor, drawing the reaction of the plasma spheres. Some hit the ground to cause electrical discharges in the gullies while others struck the *Hermes* as it fired its batteries. In the resulting collision, Rahu's core and the *Hermes* were both destroyed, leaving only heat, smoke, and a sudden quiet.

Though I couldn't see her, Iris Novak's steady voice came over the general comms, telling everyone to calm down. She claimed Tor had simplified the battlefield by clearing the path and explained that the sacrifice was necessary to save the mission. Taking command, she ordered us all forward toward the objective, though the ground under our route was unstable and shifted as we drove over it.

We entered the pyramid. The air was stable inside. The noise of the battle outside died away, leaving us in a heavy silence. Novak looked at the massive, sealed doors ahead of us. We were inside, but the mission was far from over.
