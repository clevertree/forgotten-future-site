# Chapter 6: The Sacrifice

**Title:** The Sacrifice
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The fire was large and occupied the space in front of us. Rahu moved across the ground. The air was hot. My instruments recorded multiple errors. We were standing near the edge of the heat. The pilots were giving disorganized orders on the radio.

The bike fleet moved into the canyons. They were trying to avoid the plasma. The ground forces could not advance. Large sparks appeared on the cliffs. They were spheres of plasma. They moved across the valley and targeted the fleet from above. The pilots sent distress signals. The formation broke apart.

The ship *Hermes* flew through the debris field and cleared a corridor. The plasma spheres reacted to the ship. Some hit the ground and caused electrical discharges in the gullies. Others hit the *Hermes*. The *Hermes* fired its batteries. There was a collision. Rahu's core and the *Hermes* were both destroyed. I saw heat and smoke. Then the area was quiet.

Novak looked at the soldiers. She said that Tor had cleared the path and saved the mission. She took command. We moved forward. The ground under our route was unstable. It shifted as we drove over it.

We entered the pyramid. The air was stable inside. A sealed door was torn from its hinges. Tor walked through the opening. His suit was burned and the metal plates were melted together. His crew asked if he was alive and if the threat was gone. He did not answer. He checked his equipment and looked at the breach. He said: 'Rahu waits in the chamber.' Then he prepared for the next movement.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the action compressed and immediate.
- Emphasize Lem's observational distance when describing Tor's sacrifice and later altered state.
- Avoid adding speculative metaphysics; show only what Lem can observe.
