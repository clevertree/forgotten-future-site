## Draft
The flame was a presence that took space. Rahu moved like a pressure against the ground and the air above it shimmered with heat that made instruments cough. We were small things caught in its periphery; the pilots' confidence dissolved into ragged orders.

Most of the bike fleet managed to evade the initial strikes; they peeled into canyons and between ridges, attempting to move the engagement into terrain that would disrupt the plasma's paths. Ground forces were routed and unable to press; movement stuttered beneath repeated discharges. From a high cliff ahead a bright spark leapt and then divided into coherent balls of plasma that climbed and arced across the valley as if aimed to strike the fleet from above, where cover would be ineffective. Pilots radioed distress and the formation lost its shape.

Before the arcs closed, the *Hermes* burst through the debris field and swept a corridor clear. The plasma balls reacted to the ship's passage: some missed and struck the nearest ground, sending successive lightning discharges through gullies until the energy dissipated; others re-angled and arced toward the *Hermes*'s electromagnetic wake. The *Hermes* opened with blunt, conventional batteries and the encounter became a raw collision. Rahu's core flared in response; the *Hermes* took a crippling hit. Both Rahu and the *Hermes* were destroyed in the encounter; heat and smoke consumed the scene and the field fell quiet.

Novak moved to the rail, looked at the men, and said plainly: "Tor cleared the corridor—he saved the ground forces and the mission." She then assumed command and tightened the mission's circumference. There was no time to mourn. The ground unmade itself under our route and we rode over surfaces that slid like loose paper.

The pyramid offered an uneasy shelter; its inner air steadied. A sealed door tore from its hinges with a force that came from outside the logic of structure. Tor stepped through; his suit was scorched and parts of the plating were fused. His crew gathered and asked how he had survived and whether the threat was finally ended. He did not answer with explanation—he checked his gear and spoke toward the breach: "Rahu waits in the chamber." He made no further claim and turned to prepare for what came next.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the action compressed and immediate.
- Emphasize Lem's observational distance when describing Tor's sacrifice and later altered state.
- Avoid adding speculative metaphysics; show only what Lem can observe.
