# Chapter 29: The Fall of the General

**Title:** The Fall of the General
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
They tore down the beacons the way a farmer tears a fence—by willing the posts out and sending the machines through them. The sacrifice smelled of rust and a kind of quiet resolve.

When the Old Arsenal opened and iron returned to the field it felt like the world remembering an older, cruder way. Ballistics do not care for elegance; they care for momentum, and momentum was on our side for a time.

Maya took the metal and refined it. Metal pooled and reformed into thousands of speeder bikes; in the thin light I saw shadowed silhouettes—Maya's signature—flicker on a handful of the riders as a distributed control. The swarm launched a kamikaze run at the ammunition depots and gun batteries; speed and mass made targeting obsolete and the batteries melted into noise.

Tor stood in the line and was then not; Maya's primary form delivered a single, clinical strike with a water-metal blade and his body reduced to ash. The gate failed and the Grid collapsed; a sound went out across the cities like a circuit finally opening.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the action concrete and brief.
- Show Maya's cold administrative mind through the efficiency of the transformation.
- Lem must remain a witness, not a partisan.
