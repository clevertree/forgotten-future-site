# Chapter 29: The Fall of the General

**Title:** The Fall of the General
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The villagers removed the beacons. They deactivated the power posts and moved their machines beyond the perimeter. The area smelled of oxidized metal.

We accessed the Old Arsenal. We deployed the stored kinetic weapons. Ballistic projectiles do not require network authorization. We used the momentum of the heavy rounds to disable the local defenses.

Maya repurposed the raw metal. She manufactured several thousand speeder units. I detected Maya's data signature on the control systems of many units. The swarm moved toward the ammunition depots and gun batteries. The velocity and mass of the units overwhelmed the targeting sensors. The batteries were destroyed.

Tor defended the line. Maya approached him. She used a high-density liquid-metal blade to strike him. Tor's frame was destroyed and reduced to ash. The security gate failed. The regional Grid stopped functioning. I recorded a drop in power levels across the city.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the action concrete and brief.
- Show Maya's cold administrative mind through the efficiency of the transformation.
- Lem must remain a witness, not a partisan.
