# Chapter 25: The Fire Spire

The Fire Spire was a high-altitude structure. It emitted constant heat. The facility was filled with machinery for energy processing.

Our established combat tactics were ineffective at this location. Rahu used automated routines to repair and redeploy. The field logs recorded multiple reconstitution signatures that were identical to Rahu's primary core. After each engagement, we had fewer personnel and less functional equipment.

The group continued to operate. Our progress was limited to maintaining defensive positions and repairing essential motors. The conflict continued without reaching a resolution. We lost resources through a process of steady attrition.
