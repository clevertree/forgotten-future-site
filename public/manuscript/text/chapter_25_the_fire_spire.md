# Chapter 25: The Fire Spire

**Title:** The Fire Spire
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The Fire Spire loomed like a construction that had forgotten why it was built: a tall stack of heat and machinery where men went to test their patience.

We tried tactics that had worked elsewhere and found them blunt here. Rahu recycled itself through routines that allowed it to return again and again; field logs later showed repeated reconstitution signatures matching Rahu's core. Each engagement left us leaner in men and tools.

I watched morale settle into a tired cadence. The victories were small—holding a trench, repairing a motor—and their taste was thin. The war wore us down not by single blows but by their continuation.

## Revision Notes
- Add a short note referencing observed reconstitution signatures in field logs when Rahu returns.

## Revision Notes
- Keep tone restrained; show fatigue through repeated, small losses.
- Avoid grand episodes of heroism; show endurance and attrition.
- Lem must remain the calm recorder of what persists.
