# Chapter 4: The Fall

**Title:** The Fall
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Tor spoke over the communication system. He said we had a duty to defend the truth and keep order. His voice was steady. He used words like 'defense' and 'truth.' I recognized these terms from the news. The reports said a person named 'Prometheus' was stealing technology for the invaders. The government used this story to justify their actions.

The Moon changed position. Our instruments could not track its movement. Plasma appeared at the poles in large spirals. The hull of the ship became hot. The maps and briefings we had were no longer accurate. The surface of the moon broke into pieces. Large rocks flew into space in many directions.

We were struck. The ship made a loud, metallic noise. The hull tore open. Alarms sounded. The control systems stopped working. The ship began to spin. The gravity shifted. People were thrown across the cabin.

We fell.

## Revision Notes
- Keep sensory details tight and specific; avoid dramatic flourishes.
- Make Tor's speech formal and brittle; contrast it with the raw physicality of the break.
- Maintain Lem's clinical distance while letting small human actions show the stakes.
