# Chapter 4: The Fall

**Title:** The Fall
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Tor's voice came over the comm like a policy read aloud to a room already burning. He framed our task in the language of duty: defense, truth, the preservation of order. The words were steady; what they held was no longer sufficient. The phrasing—the words 'defense' and 'truth'—echoed the headlines I'd heard: accusations of a human 'Prometheus' who was attempting to steal all knowledge and technology from humanity on behalf of the invaders, a shorthand used to brand collaborators and justify harsh measures.

The Moon began to move in a way the instruments did not have a name for. Plasma laced the poles in spirals that made the ship's hull wake with a heat the crew had not expected. The charts and briefings that had guided the fleet did not fit the view; whatever certainties we had been trained on collapsed into the viewport. Rock sheared and released itself; the surface broke into pieces that described trajectories like deliberate punctuation.

Impact was immediate and unmerciful. The *Caucasian Eagle* shrieked under the blow. Metal tore. Alarms made a language of urgency. Control systems faltered; the ship entered a violent spin as linkages failed and gravity shifted. People found themselves in slow, useless arcs.

We fell.

## Revision Notes
- Keep sensory details tight and specific; avoid dramatic flourishes.
- Make Tor's speech formal and brittle; contrast it with the raw physicality of the break.
- Maintain Lem's clinical distance while letting small human actions show the stakes.
