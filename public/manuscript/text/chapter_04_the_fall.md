# Chapter 4: The Fall

Tor spoke over the communication system, saying we had a duty to defend the truth and keep order. His voice was steady as he used words like 'defense' and 'truth.' I recognized this narrative from the news reports which said a person named 'Prometheus' was stealing technology for the invaders. The government used this story to justify their actions.

The Moon didn't change position; it began to fragment. Great chunks tore free and spiraled outward, forming a whirling wall of debris our instruments couldn't track. Plasma appeared at the poles in large spirals and the hull of the ship became hot. Because the surface of the moon was breaking into pieces, the maps and briefings we had were no longer accurate. Large rocks flew into space in many directions.

We were struck. The ship made a loud, metallic noise as the hull tore open. Alarms sounded and the control systems stopped working. As the ship began to spin, the gravity shifted and people were thrown across the cabin.

We fell.
