# Chapter 3: Zenith

The Moon grew large in the window, gaining size quickly as a blue line of atmosphere appeared along its curve. Usually space is empty, but this did not look empty, and the calculations for our approach were different from what the crew expected. On the bridge, the people were losing their focus.

An older crewman who had worked on ships for a long time sat at the station, his hands stopping as he looked at the Moon. He missed a navigation adjustment, causing a stabilizer to fail. He began to speak rapidly, his voice cracking as he pointed at the lunar horizon. Watching him, the other men's hands started to shake.

Iris stepped forward, her own posture less rigid than usual. She tried to speak to him, her voice low but carrying through the quiet bridge. "The briefing covered this," she said, leaning toward the man. "The Moon's distance and its size—it was a military record. It was classified until this mission. They opened the files so the media and the army could understand why we're here, why the mission works."

The soldier looked at her, his eyes wide. "If we hadn't done that," he spat, the words coming out jagged. "If you hadn't hidden what was right in front of us, we wouldn't have been blind when they came. We wouldn't be dying now."

Iris stopped. She looked around the bridge, realizing she had engaged a subordinate in an argument while everyone watched. She had no answer.

Lynn walked into the room. She had been standing in the hatchway, watching. She did not look at Iris. "His focus has failed," Lynn said. "He is a risk to the descent." She looked at Novak. "Remove him."

Novak moved the man toward the escape pods. He did not fight her. The pod sealed and launched in less than a minute, disappearing into the dark and leaving the room silent. No one tried to help the man or talk about him as they returned to their stations. They knew that if they stopped working, they would be next.

I watched the bridge as a man's fingers trembled and another stopped walking. I made a record of these things, adding the facts to my log.
