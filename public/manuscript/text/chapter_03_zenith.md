# Chapter 3: Zenith

The Moon grew large in the window, gaining size quickly as a blue line of atmosphere appeared along its curve. Usually space is empty, but this did not look empty, and the calculations for our approach were different from what the crew expected. On the bridge, the people were losing their focus.

An older crewman who had worked on ships for a long time sat at the station, his hands stopping as he looked at the Moon. He missed a navigation adjustment, causing a stabilizer to fail, and although he tried to say something, he couldn't finish the sentence. Watching him, the other men's hands started to shake.

Lynn walked into the room and, seeing the risk to the ship, ordered Novak to take the man away. Novak compassionately guided him to an escape pod that soon sealed and launched, leaving the room silent as the crew returned to their stations, knowing that if they stopped working, they would be next.

I watched the bridge as a man's fingers trembled and another stopped walking. I made a record of these things, adding the facts to my log.
