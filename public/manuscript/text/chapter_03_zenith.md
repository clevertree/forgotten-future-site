# Chapter 3: Zenith

The Moon was large in the window. It became bigger very quickly. I saw a blue line of atmosphere along the curve. Usually, space is empty, but this did not look empty. The calculations for our approach were different from what the crew expected. The people on the bridge were losing their focus.

An older crewman was at the station. He had worked on ships for a long time. He looked at the Moon and his hands stopped moving. He missed a navigation adjustment. A stabilizer did not fire on time. He tried to say something, but he couldn't finish the sentence. The other men watched him. Their hands started to shake.

Lynn walked into the room. She looked at the man and said he was a risk to the ship. She ordered Novak to take him away. Novak moved the man to an escape pod. It was done in less than a minute.

The pod sealed and launched. It disappeared into the dark. The room was silent. No one tried to help the man or talk about him. They went back to their stations. They knew that if they stopped working, they would be next.

I watched the bridge. I saw a man's fingers tremble. I saw another man stop walking. I made a record of these things. They were facts for my log.
