# Chapter 21: The Great Refusal

**Title:** The Great Refusal
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The ridge faced a cold sea. Some people called it the Shore of Shadows. Arlo burned his identifier plate. He placed the remains in a box. He said he was not a Vessel.

This action was repeated by others. They did not make public announcements. Many villagers began to remove their tracking beacons and ceased to attend mandatory briefings. The village records show that several people stopped following their assigned schedules.

These actions required us to change our logistics. The protocols were no longer effective because the villagers did not comply with the established rules. Refusal became a common method for the residents of the ridge.

## Revision Notes
- Treat the refusal as a tactical, human act rather than a manifesto.
- Show consequences subtly via shifts in behavior, not speeches.
- Keep Lem's voice measured and descriptive.
