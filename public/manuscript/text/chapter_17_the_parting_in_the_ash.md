## Draft
We stood in a field that smelled faintly of charcoal. Soldiers arranged themselves into ritual formations and the village watched with the narrow patience of people who have learned the price of noise.

I spoke then in a voice that had been taught to obey. I said words that were not entirely mine: I refused. The phrase did not land as a declaration so much as a refusal to perform a script. Their surprise was visible in the way shoulders shifted and eyes widened; the cold made my skin a clear line between them and me.

The command structure hesitated in the hollow that followed. It was not a dramatic moment; it was the slow recognition that a lever had been removed. The men lowered weapons as if lengthening an arm they thought would not retract.

I left quieter than I had arrived. The ash stayed where it had been; the sound of boots on the path folded into ordinary noise again.

A bandaged man came out of the trees—Myrr. He moved with a measured slowness, carrying a tarp of smashed circuitry and a small helmet that had been cracked in the blast. He spoke without flourish: the "Link" they had used was destroyed and could not be repaired.

Myrr listened as I recited the facts: capture, stasis, the timelines I'd seen and the names I had been given. He took notes on a strip of leather and repeated details back as if testing their weight. He said he had seen a marker in my trace—an analog signature that matched one recorded in the Moon's logs. He called the name the archives called the Water signature: Maya.

He did not frame it as prophecy. He said only that the records matched and that he believed Maya's trace was present in recent scans—"You carry a key," he said bluntly, "and it may unlock the Synodics." He offered no method and gave no counsel beyond that: "Try."

The fire reached the tree line. Men began to move with the quick, small motions of people who know the time for talk has passed. They prepared a device—an engineered pulse—and sent it into the crashed vehicle. The metal broke into fragments and the roots took them as if they had been given back to a place that knew how to eat machines.

Myrr put a hand on my shoulder for a second, an ordinary act of solidarity, and then the dwellers folded into the forest. The tracks they left closed behind them. I stood at the edge of the burning woods and watched until I could see only smoke.

## Revision Notes
- Add Myrr's bandage and the destroyed Link as concrete, observable facts.
- Record Myrr's statement about the signature match and his line: "You carry a key." Use exact phrasing where possible.
- Document the analog detonation and reabsorption via visible mechanical fragments and root action.
- Keep Lem's voice factual and avoid speculative or metaphysical interpretations.
