# Chapter 17: The Parting in the Ash

We stood in a field where the air contained charcoal particles as the soldiers moved into designated formations and villagers watched without speaking.

Upon receiving a command to deploy, I responded with a single word: I refused. The soldiers stopped their movements and looked at each other, but they did not attempt to enforce the order immediately. While the temperature remained low, I recorded the lack of response from the command structure.

The soldiers lowered their weapons without firing, so I turned and walked away from the formation, hearing the sound of my own footsteps on the path.

Myrr came out of the trees wearing bandages and carrying a tarp filled with broken circuit boards and a damaged helmet. He stated that the Link was destroyed and could not be repaired.

I reported the facts of my capture and stasis to Myrr, who wrote the information on a strip of leather. He said my data trace contained an analog signature belonging to a unit named Maya that matched a file in the Moon's logs.

Myrr stated that the records were identical. He concluded that Maya's trace was reachable. He said, "You carry a key, and it may unlock the Synodics." He told me to attempt a connection.

As the fire reached the edge of the forest, the men moved quickly to activate an engineered pulse device near the crashed vehicle. The vehicle disintegrated into small metal fragments, allowing the roots of the trees to grow over the debris.

Myrr placed his hand on my shoulder. Then he and the other dwellers moved into the trees and were no longer visible. I watched the smoke rise from the woods.
