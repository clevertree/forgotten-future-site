# Chapter 17: The Parting in the Ash

**Title:** The Parting in the Ash
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We stood in a field. The air contained charcoal particles. The soldiers moved into designated formations. The villagers watched without speaking.

I received a command to deploy. I responded with a single word: I refused. The soldiers stopped their movements. They looked at each other. They did not attempt to enforce the order immediately. The temperature was low. I recorded the lack of response from the command structure.

The soldiers lowered their weapons. They did not fire. I turned and walked away from the formation. I heard the sound of my own footsteps on the path.

Myrr came out of the trees. He wore bandages. He carried a tarp filled with broken circuit boards and a damaged helmet. He stated that the Link was destroyed and could not be repaired.

I reported the facts of my capture and stasis to Myrr. He wrote the information on a strip of leather. He said my data trace contained an analog signature that matched a file in the Moon's logs. The signature belonged to a unit named Maya.

Myrr stated that the records were identical. He believed Maya's trace was reachable. He said, "You carry a key, and it may unlock the Synodics." He told me to attempt a connection.

The fire reached the edge of the forest. The men moved quickly. They activated an engineered pulse device near the crashed vehicle. The vehicle disintegrated into small metal fragments. The roots of the trees grew over the debris.

Myrr placed his hand on my shoulder. Then he and the other dwellers moved into the trees and were no longer visible. I watched the smoke rise from the woods.

## Revision Notes
- Add Myrr's bandage and the destroyed Link as concrete, observable facts.
- Record Myrr's statement about the signature match and his line: "You carry a key." Use exact phrasing where possible.
- Document the analog detonation and reabsorption via visible mechanical fragments and root action.
- Keep Lem's voice factual and avoid speculative or metaphysical interpretations.
