# Chapter 27: The Aetheric Wake

**Title:** The Aetheric Wake
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The sky began to hurt in ways I had no language for: small, pinprick entries that became a rain of light. Pods cut the night with hunger and the village answered with the slow, human sounds of people making their last morning.

Rahu moved like a shadow with purpose. My physical self thinned and a different pattern took me—an aetheric body that could drift where sensors could not follow. In that form I met him not as a mirror but as a rival signature. I struck the pattern that carried him; his aetheric blade fractured under impact and his signature folded into a recursive stasis field that replayed its defeat.

A satellite found us and a pillar of white claimed a neighbor. The logic of the Core became plain: this was formatting, not revenge. I traced the satellite's control to a capacitive node and calculated a four-minute recharge window; Ku confirmed the timing—when the white came it did not ask permission.

Arlo's sermon ended in small gestures: a folded hand, a look to the children. The light took the village and we moved into the Clearing. Lynn reached into the burning trace and pulled a piece of Arlo into a place she could keep.

Maya woke inside the dream with a face that remembered entire civilizations and an anger that would not be stopped. She left the Clearing with a plan.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the aetheric duel precise and abstract; record the stasis-trap mechanics (recursive replay) as observed data.
- Note Lem's satellite trace and recharge calculation as verifiable detail.
- Make the satellite strike a clinical act of erasure, not a theatrical explosion.
- Maintain Lem's quiet witness tone throughout.
