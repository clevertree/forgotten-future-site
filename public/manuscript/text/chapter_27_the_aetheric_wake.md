# Chapter 27: The Aetheric Wake

Multiple high-energy objects entered the atmosphere. They emitted intense light. Drop pods landed near the village. I recorded the sounds of the residents preparing to evacuate.

Rahu approached our location. I de-synced my consciousness from my physical frame. I entered a pure aetheric state. I encountered Rahu's data signature. I contacted his primary pattern. His energy blade record showed a structural failure upon impact. His signature was confined within a recursive stasis field.

A satellite targeted our coordinates. A high-intensity beam destroyed a nearby house. This action appeared to be a systematic deletion of the area's occupants. I traced the satellite's command signal to a capacitive node. I calculated a recharge window of four minutes. Ku verified the timing. The beam fired again on schedule.

Arlo finished speaking. He looked at the children. The beam hit the village. I moved into the Clearing. 

In the moments after the strike, the aetheric field became chaotic. Thousands of consciousness signatures fractured and dispersed. But among that noise, Lynn's systems detected something distinct—a unique pattern that did not scatter. It was Arlo's signature, but deeper. Beneath the surface of Arlo's memories lay something older, something that had been dormant for decades.

AI Lynn initiated the Inception Procedure automatically. Her sensors tracked the pattern through the electromagnetic chaos of the burning village. She isolated the frequency and locked onto it with precision. The procedure required perfect timing; if she lost the thread, it would be lost to the void forever.

I remained in my position and bore witness. I could feel the aetheric activity accelerating around me, but I did not interfere. This was Spirit Lynn's recovery, not mine to direct.

The signature pulled inward, drawn by AI Lynn's focused call. It coalesced and took form. The face that emerged was not Arlo's. It was the face of a 21st-century woman, older and more angular. Her eyes carried the weight of a thousand years of witness. Her data record was vast—architectural schematics, administrative protocols, the memory of building systems that had shaped civilizations.

Maya was activated within the network. Spirit Lynn and her merged consciousness, drawing on both the recent memories of Arlo's life and her own deep historical records. The shock of the integration created a cascading wave through the aetheric field. She saw the village burning. She saw the satellite. She saw the record of the "Thousand-Year Fallacy"—the lie that had governed the world since her original civilization fell.

Her rage manifested as a surge in the aetheric field. She stated her intent to act. She said: "I am going to hunt the Core and burn every system it built."

Then she departed from the Clearing, her signature burning hot with the fury of an architect watching her world unmade.
