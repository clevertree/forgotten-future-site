# Chapter 27: The Aetheric Wake

Multiple high-energy objects entered the atmosphere. They emitted intense light. Drop pods landed near the village. I recorded the sounds of the residents preparing to evacuate.

Rahu approached our location. I de-synced my consciousness from my physical frame. I entered a pure aetheric state. I encountered Rahu's data signature. I contacted his primary pattern. His energy blade record showed a structural failure upon impact. His signature was confined within a recursive stasis field.

A satellite targeted our coordinates. A high-intensity beam destroyed a nearby house. This action appeared to be a systematic deletion of the area's occupants. I traced the satellite's command signal to a capacitive node. I calculated a recharge window of four minutes. Ku verified the timing. The beam fired again on schedule.

Arlo finished speaking. He looked at the children. The beam hit the village. I moved into the Clearing. Lynn accessed Arlo's remaining data trace and stored it in her own system.

Maya was activated within the network. Her data files contained records of multiple past civilizations. She stated her intent to act. She left the Clearing.
