# Chapter 26: The Gathering of Strands

We withdrew from our positions. We reclassified our assets and repurposed our circuit boards. We recorded the number of personnel in a ledger. The northern combat zone was converted into a logistics hub.

We relocated the survivors and the functional machinery to a central location. We established a defensive perimeter. We selected which components to keep and which to disassemble for parts. The ledger recorded twelve frame couplers and three drive cores. We created a schedule for three convoys to transport materials north over a period of three nights.

We used the lists of parts and supply routes to organize our defense. This was our plan. We gathered the remaining resources to continue the mission.
