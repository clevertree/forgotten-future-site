# Chapter 26: The Gathering of Strands

**Title:** The Gathering of Strands
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
We pulled back in a slow and mechanical fashion. Assets were reclassified, circuits repurposed, and people counted in rows on paper. The northern line became a belt of logistics rather than a battlefront.

We moved survivors and machines to form a circle that could be held: an inward solution to an outward problem. There was an economy to this—who to move, what to leave, which parts to cannibalize. The ledger listed twelve frame couplers, three drive cores, and a schedule for convoys to move parts north over three nights.

Hope arrived as a ledger: lists of parts, routes of supply, schedules of who would stand where. It was not a song; it was a plan. The strands we gathered would be the measure of our persistence.

## Revision Notes
- Record specific ledger entries (parts & convoy schedule) to make logistics concrete and verifiable.

## Revision Notes
- Focus on the logistics and decisions rather than rhetoric.
- Keep Lem's voice precise and slightly removed.
- Show hope as administrative and functional rather than sentimental.
