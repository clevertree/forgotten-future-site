# Chapter 16: Forest Awakening

Upon returning to the forest, I found the root systems producing a low-frequency hum that matched ground vibrations. I found Rahu there moving slowly, still emitting a high thermal signature.

Describing my function, he claimed I was an organic data unit capable of being reconstructed from any surviving fragment. He showed me the data shard from the Moon where logs recorded an ordered reset command with timing traces that matched independent archives.

I accessed the root network and found an aetheric echo of my previous signatures, the data indicating that the Core modifies historical records to maintain social stability.

Ordered by Rahu to demonstrate control over the local environment, I manipulated a cluster of roots to enclose a rogue drone until it stopped moving. Rahu told me to return to the Cradle and resume my role; I agreed, although I intended to follow my own objectives.
