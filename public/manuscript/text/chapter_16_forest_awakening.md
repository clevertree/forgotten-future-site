# Chapter 16: Forest Awakening

**Title:** Forest Awakening
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I returned to the forest. The root systems produced a low-frequency hum that matched the vibrations in the ground. I found Rahu there. He moved slowly. He still emitted a high thermal signature.

He described my function. He said I was an organic data unit that could be reconstructed from any surviving fragment. He showed me the data shard from the Moon. The logs recorded an ordered reset command. The timing traces matched independent archives.

I accessed the root network. It contained an aetheric echo of my previous signatures. The data indicated that the Core modifies historical records to maintain social stability.

Rahu ordered me to demonstrate control over the local environment. I manipulated a cluster of roots to enclose a rogue drone. The drone stopped moving. Rahu told me to return to the Cradle and resume my role. I agreed, although I intended to follow my own objectives.

## Revision Notes
- Keep Rahu's voice weary and pragmatic.
- Make the forest's intelligence clinical and non-sentimental.
- Emphasize Lem's intentional dishonesty as a protective strategy rather than theatrical deception.
