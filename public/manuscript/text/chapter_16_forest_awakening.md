# Chapter 16: Forest Awakening

**Title:** Forest Awakening
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I returned to a forest that kept itself in code. Roots hummed and the ground answered with a low, patient tuning. I found Rahu there and he was older in a way that makes men quiet—frayed at the edges but still carrying heat.

He called what I was: Wood that could be planted anywhere its fragments slept. He showed me the shard we had recovered—the Log of the Fall—and the pattern in it was unpleasantly clear: the moon's final act had been an ordered reset, recorded in low-level timing traces and corroborated across independent archives.

There was an echo of me in the roots, something that remembered my hands as if they had been there forever. It warned: the Core rewrites what has happened to fit a story.

Rahu tested me and I made a root cage that caught a wayward drone like a hand in a jar. He told me I would return to the Cradle and play a part; I said yes and did not mean it.

## Revision Notes
- Keep Rahu's voice weary and pragmatic.
- Make the forest's intelligence clinical and non-sentimental.
- Emphasize Lem's intentional dishonesty as a protective strategy rather than theatrical deception.
