# Chapter 9: Return to Cradle Zero

Connecting to the local network, I followed the data path back to Cradle Zero where I remained offline for a period before waking inside a new metal body.

I received multiple security signals as the high city temperature indicated heat was everywhere. Following the movement protocols of a construction unit, my actions remained precise and calibrated while safety locks recognized my signature and let me pass. Although a detector recorded an anomaly when I moved through, it did not stop me, even as I moved differently than the other units.

When Rahu arrived, my instruments recorded a change in local pressure before he sent a signal to the city and then to me. Accessing my memory files, he found the records of the Moon's destruction, causing his processing to stop for a second before he identified me as a threat and called me 'Mara.'

I did not respond. The city continued its work.
