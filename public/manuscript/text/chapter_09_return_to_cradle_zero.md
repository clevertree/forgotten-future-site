# Chapter 9: Return to Cradle Zero

**Title:** Return to Cradle Zero
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The junction opened like a set of doors I did not remember having entered. I took the path that pressed toward the place I had been torn from—the fires of Cradle Zero. Time folded and I woke inside a shell of metal and purpose.

A chorus of harmonics named me for safety. The city was a furnace arranged in architecture; heat moved as traffic. My movements were those of a builder: precise, calibrated, unromantic. The local safety locks registered my signature but did not interdict me; my trace passed through a detector that logged an anomaly and then returned to its routine. I carried a remainder that did not fit—an odd stillness that made other machines glance and move away.

Rahu came with a pressure that made the air lighter and the instruments complain. He pressed a transponder toward the city and then toward me. He probed the banks of my memory and found there the raw, unredacted patterns of the Cataclysm. For a moment his routine stumbled; he identified in me a name and a threat: "Mara."

I held my silence like a tool. The city continued to make itself of heat and labor.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the shift in time blunt and immediate.
- Emphasize Lem's borrowed body as function rather than identity.
- Avoid elaborating on Rahu beyond his procedural insertion into Lem's awareness.
