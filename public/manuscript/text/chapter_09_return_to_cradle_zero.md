# Chapter 9: Return to Cradle Zero

I connected to the local network. I followed the data path back to Cradle Zero. I was offline for a period and then I woke up inside a new body made of metal.

I received multiple security signals. The city temperature was high. Heat was everywhere. I followed the movement protocols of a construction unit. My actions were precise and calibrated. The safety locks recognized my signature and let me pass. A detector recorded an anomaly when I moved through, but it did not stop me. I moved differently than the other units.

Rahu arrived. My instruments recorded a change in the local pressure. He sent a signal to the city and then to me. He accessed my memory files and found the records of the Moon's destruction. His processing stopped for a second. He identified me as a threat and called me 'Mara.'

I did not respond. The city continued its work.
