# Chapter 5: Alone on the Moon

The crash caused multiple injuries as the ship's interior grew loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe, alone in the wreckage; no crew was in sight.

Before I could look around, a machine removed me from the wreckage. Iris Novak was there, looking over a handheld display—she had already initiated the extraction. She didn't look at me at first. I heard a report coming through her headset. Someone was telling her the final numbers on the evacuation of the ship I had just been on. They said sixty percent of the crew had made it to the escape pods.

It turned out Iris and her team were among those who had escaped. I hadn't seen them leave. I had been caught up in the noise and the shaking, not knowing which way to run or whose orders to follow. In the chaos, I had simply been left behind.

Once Novak finally noticed me, she spoke in short, factual sentences. A message arrived from Lynn stating that my internal drive was functioning and I was ready for the mission, though I could still feel the vibration of the impact in my frame.

While the other survivors left the area, I sat in a small hover vehicle and chose not to follow them. I took the vehicle and joined the strike teams moving forward.

Built with precise lines and angles, lunar structures loomed as large machine Striders moved across the surface. I saw the Striders move with a frantic, purposive motion. When one Strider was destroyed, the radio went quiet.

Plasma began to lift from distant outposts as slow, swelling balls of ionized energy while my heat sensors recorded intense discharges. At first the fleet treated them as distant fire, but when several of the spheres suddenly accelerated and arced toward the metal frames of our vehicles, the pilots realized they were being targeted. The forward units were destroyed as the fleet tried to draw the fire toward the mountains, but the plasma ran along the canyon walls and kept pace until the formation broke apart.

A human pilot in the bike fleet peeled off and moved toward a cliff where a light was flashing. He sent a telemetry report. It said: 'Confirmed: Rahu.' Right after that, the pilot disappeared into the flash of an explosion as the plasma ball struck.
