# Chapter 5: Alone on the Moon

The crash caused multiple injuries as the ship's interior grew loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe, alone in the wreckage; there were no other crew members in sight.

Before I could look around, a machine removed me from the wreckage. Iris Novak was there, looking over a handheld display—she had already initiated the extraction. She didn't look at me at first. I heard a report coming through her headset. Someone was telling her the final numbers on the evacuation of the ship I had just been on. They said sixty percent of the crew had made it to the escape pods.

It turned out Iris and her team were among those who had escaped. I hadn't seen them leave; I had been left behind in the chaos.
