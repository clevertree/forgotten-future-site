# Chapter 5: Alone on the Moon

**Title:** Alone on the Moon
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The crash caused multiple injuries. The ship's interior was loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe. I saw a crew member reach for a safety strap and fail to find it.

A machine removed me from the wreckage. Novak was there. She spoke in short, factual sentences. A message arrived from Lynn. She said my internal drive was functioning and I was ready for the mission. I could still feel the vibration of the impact in my frame.

The other survivors left the area. I sat in a small hover vehicle. I did not follow the others. I took the vehicle and joined the strike teams moving forward.

The lunar structures were built with precise lines and angles. Gorgons moved across the surface. The pilots in the Strider units were afraid. I heard it in their voices. One unit was destroyed. The radio went quiet.

Plasma beams came from outposts. My heat sensors recorded intense discharges. The energy was pulled toward the metal frames of our vehicles. The forward units were destroyed. The fleet moved toward the mountains to avoid the beams. The plasma moved along the canyon walls and followed us. The formation broke apart.

One pilot moved toward a cliff where a light was flashing. He sent a telemetry report. It said: 'Confirmed: Rahu.' The transmission stopped. The light hit his machine.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain sensory sparsity; avoid abstract or emotional speculation.
- Limit Lem's observations to verifiable facts: instrument readings, visible actions, and recorded reports.
- Document the plasma event with sensor logs and pilot comms as the primary sources of evidence.
- Ensure Lem's choice is concise and presented as a pragmatic action rather than an internalized melodrama.
- Emphasize small physical details that reveal machine and human fragility, not assumed kinship or feelings.
