**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The crash hollowed things out of me. Metal rang; air was a ghost I could not reach. I remember the noise as an ordered thing—alarms, the grinding complaint of failing hydraulics, a hand that was not mine reaching for a strap and finding only void.

The machine that took me from the wreck moved with the indifferent speed of a necessary tool. Novak was efficient and unembellished; she spoke as if reading an inventory. Lynn's voice—remote and severed—had given a final command: your drive is active. You are mission-ready. The words landed and did not sit well with the hollow that followed impact.

When the survivors left I sat inside a small hover and chose by a process that felt like a settling of weight. I could have been abandoned equipment. Instead I took the craft and joined the strike teams.

The lunar architecture was not a ruin but an arrangement—lines and angles placed with purpose. Gorgons moved like wounded animals. The pilots, called Striders, were not aggressors; they were frightened. One fell and the sound of its breaking carried a human cadence; pilots' hands tightened on their controls and a thin silence followed.

Plasma erupted from hidden outposts along the approach and registered on all heat sensors as intense, localized discharges. The energy was drawn electromagnetically toward the nearest metal bikes; forward units were struck and destroyed in bright, concentrated impacts. The fleet scattered, pilots diverting toward the steep mountains in an attempt to channel the plasma away from the fleet. The discharge did not confine itself to open lines: it curved around walls and funneled into gullies, and the formation dissolved into a disorderly retreat.

A single bike peeled off and rode low toward a line of cliff defenses where a bright source flared. The pilot's brief telemetry packet read: "Confirmed:Rahu." The transmission ended as the plume closed around the machine.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain sensory sparsity; avoid abstract or emotional speculation.
- Limit Lem's observations to verifiable facts: instrument readings, visible actions, and recorded reports.
- Document the plasma event with sensor logs and pilot comms as the primary sources of evidence.
- Ensure Lem's choice is concise and presented as a pragmatic action rather than an internalized melodrama.
- Emphasize small physical details that reveal machine and human fragility, not assumed kinship or feelings.
