# Chapter 5: Alone on the Moon

The crash caused multiple injuries. The ship's interior was loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe. I saw a crew member reach for a safety strap and fail to find it.

A machine removed me from the wreckage. Iris Novak was there, looking over a handheld display. She didn't look at me at first. I heard a report coming through her headset. Someone was telling her the final numbers on the evacuation of the ship I had just been on. They said sixty percent of the crew had made it to the escape pods.

It turned out Iris and her team were among those who had escaped. I hadn't seen them leave. I had been caught up in the noise and the shaking, not knowing which way to run or whose orders to follow. In the chaos, I had simply been left behind.

Novak spoke in short, factual sentences once she finally noticed I was functional. A message arrived from Lynn. She said my internal drive was functioning and I was ready for the mission. I could still feel the vibration of the impact in my frame.

The other survivors left the area. I sat in a small hover vehicle. I did not follow the others. I took the vehicle and joined the strike teams moving forward.

The lunar structures were built with precise lines and angles. Large machines, the Striders, moved across the surface. The Gorgons within them were afraid. I heard it in their voices over the open frequencies. One Strider was destroyed. The radio went quiet.

Plasma beams came from outposts. My heat sensors recorded intense discharges. The energy was pulled toward the metal frames of our vehicles. The forward units were destroyed. The fleet moved toward the mountains to avoid the beams. The plasma moved along the canyon walls and followed us. The formation broke apart.

A human pilot in the bike fleet peeled off and moved toward a cliff where a light was flashing. He sent a telemetry report. It said: 'Confirmed: Rahu.' Right after that, I saw him toggle his communication switch to the off position. He didn't say anything as the light hit his machine. He didn't yell. He just disappeared into the flash. I don't know why he turned it off, but I noted the silence.
