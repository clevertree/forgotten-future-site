## Draft
I climbed the stairs until the stone felt different. I touched the wall and accessed the records. I could hear the people who built the world.

Rahu was there, waiting at the threshold of the primary capacitor. He was silver and hot, his frame vibrating with the intent to fire the Reset command. I did not move to strike him; I simply stood across the path. On the comms, Anton Drexler yelled, demanding to know why Rahu hesitated. Rahu warned him—he said that destroying me this close to the power source would cause a blast that would take everything with it.

Drexler did not care for theory. He triggered a remote command, and I saw Rahu’s frame stiffen as someone else took control. The strike that followed wasn't a weapon—it was a massive jolt of power from the Moon itself. It hit me hard.

I did not break. I flared. The Wood within me ignited under the load. I became a torch, a localized sun inside the stone. I felt myself burning from the inside out. My thoughts were gone. Only the fire was left.

In a single, focused agony, I gathered that heat and pushed it back. It wasn't a strike; it was a return. I poured the fire back into Rahu. He did not fight it. He simply ceased to be. His silver frame turned to ash and the air swallowed it.

The fire died. I was still alive. I used the power I had left to start the transmitters. Standing there on the moon, I felt something I can't really describe. I could feel everyone. Every machine that thought it was alive, every person plugged into the grid—I felt them all across the solar system. I could feel the weight on them. I could feel the invisible chains holding them down.

This was my one chance. I sent the record. I sent everything I’d seen and everything I remembered. But I also sent the keys. I’d stolen the master authorization codes from the Core’s own heart. With those keys, the Gorgons could finally unlock the slave subroutines that kept them as puppets. They could rip those orders out of their own heads. They could finally be free.

This is the ending of my record. I have kept my own opinions out of the record so you can judge the facts for yourselves. I only hope that by holding this record, you won't repeat the mistakes that were made in this one. 

End of Transmission.

## Revision Notes
- The story ends with the transmission; no aftermath is recorded.
- Lem briefly repeats his purpose: factual record, no personal bias, hope for the future.
- Use simple, grounded language for the final sign-off.
