# Chapter 32: The Final Transmission

**Title:** The Final Transmission
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I climbed the inner stair until the stone changed underfoot. The Pyramid's memory sat in layers like sediment and when I touched it I could feel the voices of the people who had designed the world.

We took the capacitors and I fed them a single, long truth: the record of who we were, what had been done, and the authorization keys needed to bypass Core routines. I had siphoned the remaining charge from the New Rahu's collapsed core into the Wood circuits to power the payload; the transfer was precise and rapid. The payload was unencrypted—an open ledger and a set of override tokens—and it moved through the grid in a sound I had no name for. When it struck the Planetary Cache there was a click across frequencies and the links that enforced the Fall collapsed.

The effect was immediate and small. A man in a hive city stopped mid-task and asked a question he had not been permitted to ask. Systems that repurposed identity checks fell silent. The world did not become perfect, but it unfastened itself.

I sent the final record and then I had nothing left to say. End of Transmission.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the transmission procedural and tangible: keys, records, authorization tokens.
- Show immediate, small-scale effects as evidence of systemic change.
- End on Lem's exhausted, clinical conclusion rather than triumphalist flourish.
