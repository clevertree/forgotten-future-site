# Chapter 30: The Lunar Assault

The city operations were disrupted. Machinery continued to execute pre-programmed loops without human supervision. We launched using organic-based craft. The ascent was silent and efficient.

We navigated the lunar debris field. It was composed of numerous metal and glass fragments. Electrical discharges occurred between the objects. The collisions caused vibrations throughout our hull. We passed a large, damaged vehicle. It was identified as the original Rahu unit. The Pyramid structure was located at the center of the field. Its surface showed blue light patterns consistent with previous energy discharges.

The defensive system fired high-intensity energy beams. Our shields shifted phase to dissipate the heat. We used water-based and organic-based systems to stabilize the environment. I verified that my internal schematics were designed to withstand these specific energy types.

The entrance to the structure opened. The Director unit was located at the threshold. It remained in a fixed position.
