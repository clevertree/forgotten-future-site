# Chapter 30: The Lunar Assault

**Title:** The Lunar Assault
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The world had gone oddly quiet. Machines moved in loops because their center had been cut—procedures continued without audience. We launched on craft grown like seeds and the ascent felt less like a roar and more like an unpeeling.

The debris field was a delicate lattice of broken things. Lightning jumped between fragments and every crossing made the hull hum with complaint. We passed a wreckage that was older than the rest—the husk of the original Rahu vehicle, a frozen archive of metal and scorched plating. The Pyramid sat like a bone in the center—its surfaces rippled with the blue memory of the Fry.

The gauntlet threw white suns at us and our shields replied by shifting phase and letting the heat become water and then dust. We did not match fire with fire; we let water and root do the work. I understood, in a small, formal way, that the design in my frame was a corrected blueprint—an answer to what had failed before.

The entrance opened and the archive waited. The Director—perhaps a living thing, perhaps a copy—watched the threshold as if it had patience.

## Revision Notes
- Maintain clinical descriptions of navigation and energy phenomena.
- Emphasize the elemental strategy over brute force.
- Keep Lem's role as observer and reluctant leader clear.
