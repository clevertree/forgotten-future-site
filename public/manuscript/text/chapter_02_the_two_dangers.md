# Chapter 2: The Two Dangers

**Title:** The Two Dangers
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The boarding line smelled of diesel and cheap coffee; the men around me moved with a practiced impatience. A guard singled me out with the sort of glance that catalogs an absence—no mandatory briefing code, an age that did not fit. He asked for a reason. I could not supply one I owned. Behind us, through the terminal glass, the monoliths had reached into the city: legs like towers and frames that swallowed streets; they moved toward the center with a slow, deliberate aim.

Lynn arrived like a punctuation. She entered with a neutrality that made questions stop. The guard made a small correction of posture and let us pass. She spoke to me in a voice that carried no tenderness and less explanation: embed, follow orders, remember that she would be watching. That last sentence was not a comfort.

The ship was a captured sky inside a hull. Ropes of cable and aerodynamic ribs wove overhead like the skeleton of something too big to be thought; the drive systems hummed with a low, mechanical patience. Soldiers unpacked rituals—strap, check, recite—small repeated acts that pretended to stitch them to certainty.

Launch was thin and precise. The ship left the air as if releasing a held breath; the city shrank in slow, hard steps through the viewport. In that widening I saw the monoliths converge on the city's grid—lines of machines angling toward the central plants—and I noticed men who had been uncertain straighten, their doubt giving way to a hard, mechanical resolve.

Conversations scraped by me—the disjointed talk of men trained to brace for deceit. They referred to their psychological briefing as if it were a weapon: "narrative warfare," they called it. There were two dangers, one said: falsehood dressed as revelation; the other, a truth released at a strategic moment to destabilize trust. The phrase clung to the metal in the air.

They argued about a particular piece of intelligence the briefing had hinted at, a framing of what waited at the lunar site that made their voices go flat and small. I listened because listening was what I was chosen for. I catalogued their fear the way a carpenter catalogs knots in timber—factually, without commentary.

I walked the ship and watched faces practice their confidence. The armor of certainty did not fit any better close up; it cut into the flesh like ill-fitting clothing. My passivity folded into function: not a soldier, not a spectator, but someone whose silence could hold other people's truths until needed.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the tone quiet and observational. 
- Emphasize the details that reveal institutional fracture rather than elaborate backstory.
- Maintain Lem's evolving vocabulary—start human, add clinical terms only as he learns them.
