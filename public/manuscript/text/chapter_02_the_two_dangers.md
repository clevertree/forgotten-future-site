# Chapter 2: The Two Dangers

The boarding line smelled of diesel and cheap coffee. The men waiting with me were impatient. A guard pulled me aside. He looked for a briefing code in my file and didn't find one. He asked why I was there. I did not have an answer. Behind us, I saw the monoliths through the window. They were taller than the buildings. They were moving into the city center.

Lynn arrived. She was calm. The guard changed his posture and let us through. She told me my job: stay close and follow orders. She said she would be watching me. I did not like the way she said it.

The inside of the ship was huge. There were cables and supports everywhere. The engines made a steady noise. The soldiers were busy with their equipment. They checked their straps and repeated their instructions. They were trying to look ready.

We launched. The ship left the ground. I watched the city get smaller through the port. The monoliths were clustering around the power plants. The men in the cabin sat up straight. They looked more focused now.

I listened to the conversations. The men were talking about the briefing. They called it 'narrative warfare.' One soldier said there are two dangers: a lie that sounds like a revelation, or a truth used to break your trust. He said the mission was designed to confuse us.

They argued about the intelligence reports for the moon. They sounded worried. I listened to everything. That was why Lynn brought me. I made a record of their fear.

I walked through the corridors. The soldiers tried to look confident, but they were nervous. I didn't say anything. I just watched.
