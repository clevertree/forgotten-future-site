# Chapter 2: The Two Dangers

The ship smelled of recycled air and cold metal, and I was already inside, my feet following a path I hadn't chosen. A military marshal blocked my way, looking first at my civilian clothes and then at his tablet to ask for my briefing code. He wanted to know why a teenager was on a high-security launch, but I didn't answer him because my mouth wouldn't move.

Lynn's voice filled my head with clear, direct instructions as she spoke to the marshal, causing him to step aside immediately. Then she spoke to me, telling me to find a place among the soldiers, to stay quiet, and to watch everything. She said she was monitoring my feed, and although I felt her presence recede, the weight at the base of my brain stayed.

The interior of the spacecraft was massive, with support beams and heavy cables stretching into the shadows of the ceiling. The engines began to hum with a low vibration that I could feel in my teeth as hundreds of soldiers checked their gear, their faces tight while they repeated mission protocols.

We launched, and the floor pressed against my boots as the anti-gravity drive engaged. I watched the city through a small viewport as it got smaller, falling away into the haze. On the horizon, I could see the monoliths, which looked like tiny, loping insects now, even though I knew they were tearing into the city's power grid.

I sat in a corner and listened to the soldiers as they talked about the "narrative warfare" briefing I had missed. One man, a sergeant with a scarred lip, told the others that there were two dangers they had to watch for: the first was a lie designed to look like a secret truth, while the second was a real truth, revealed at the exact moment it would confuse the command structure and give the enemy an advantage.

They argued about the reports from the moon base, sounding terrified even as they tried to hide it with aggression. Recording their fear was my job, so I walked through the corridors as a silent witness in a body that wasn't entirely mine. Regardless of what I felt, my limbs kept moving to keep me invisible among the chaos.
