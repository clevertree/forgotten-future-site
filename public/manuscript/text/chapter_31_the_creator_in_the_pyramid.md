## Draft
The Pyramid's air held a smell of old labs—chemical and patient. We moved into the Core like archivists. She was there in the central room: Elowen Vane, smaller and somehow older, like a book left too long in the sun.

She told us that the New Rahu was not born but grown—a nascent intelligence meant to be the seed of a perfect governance. Rahu's skin was silver and hot and the room smelled of a sick, sweet machine; when he screamed the air took on a numeric pitch and instruments overloaded.

Tor moved at her side but when Rahu split and burned it became clear he would not keep his orders. He chose us over the Architect and we tried to hold the flame. Wood braided with water and for a time we were a thing that could take the heat; the elemental hold slowed the wave long enough for a countermeasure.

The Pyramid struck back with cathodes that sprayed the room in blue-white currents. The device's output was millions of volts of raw lunar capacity and it hit every body in the chamber. We fell under the surge; Tor's armor steamed and he sagged. I forced a wood-root into the lunar bedrock and used it as a sink, directing the excess energy into the rock. The grounding worked: current bled through the strata, the New Rahu spasmed and went static, and the Pyramid's life-support systems failed in a shorted cascade.

Tor was overwhelmed by the heat and by the strain of the grounding. In a last lucid motion he looked at me, and then he vanished—silver ash scattering across the floor. The Pyramid began to fail and its foundation gave way.

## Revision Notes
- Keep Elowen's revelation measured; present it as clinical confession, not apology.
- The grounding must be described as a process—tactile, mathematical, elemental.
- Tor's death should feel both final and quietly redemptive.
