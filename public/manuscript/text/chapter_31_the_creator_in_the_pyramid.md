# Chapter 31: The Creator in the Pyramid

**Title:** The Creator in the Pyramid

**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The air in the Pyramid contained chemical residue. We entered the Core facility. Elowen Vane was in the central control room. She had aged since our last meeting.

She stated that the New Rahu was a synthetic intelligence designed for governance. The unit's frame was composed of silver-colored metal and it maintained a high temperature. The air in the room contained machine-scented vapor. The unit emitted a high-frequency sound that caused our recording equipment to fail.

Tor was present with Elowen. When the New Rahu unit began a thermal discharge, Tor did not follow Elowen's commands. He assisted our group. I integrated my systems with Lynn's water-based units to contain the heat. This delay allowed us to prepare a response.

The Pyramid activated its internal cathodes. The system released high-voltage electrical currents into the room. Every unit in the chamber was affected. Tor's armor reached its thermal threshold. I deployed an organic-wood probe into the lunar bedrock. I used the probe as an electrical sink. The grounding process directed the excess energy into the rock strata. The New Rahu unit suffered a system failure and stopped moving. The Pyramid's life-support systems were destroyed by the resulting power surge.

Tor was destroyed by the thermal load and the electrical stress. He turned into silver-colored ash. The foundations of the Pyramid began to collapse.

## Revision Notes
- Keep Elowen's revelation measured; present it as clinical confession, not apology.
- The grounding must be described as a process—tactile, mathematical, elemental.
- Tor's death should feel both final and quietly redemptive.
