# Chapter 15: The Final Word

**Title:** The Final Word
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I watched the clearing through the Branching Paths data stream while the soldiers took Myrr away. I recorded the sounds of their movements. I wanted to find Cassia, but I was intercepted.

Anton Drexler spoke to me. He said that facts were only useful if they supported the current mission. He said that the records of the past had to be deleted to make room for the future. He believed that erasing history was necessary for progress.

He gave me a message for Myrr. Then he activated an electrostatic stasis field around my unit. I was placed in long-term stasis. The system log recorded a high-energy lock and the exact time of the event.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the exchange clinical and succinct.
- Present Anton's fatalism as a pragmatic ideology rather than an abstract villainy.
- Emphasize Lem's choice to seek truth despite predictable consequences.
