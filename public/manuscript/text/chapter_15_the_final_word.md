# Chapter 15: The Final Word

**Title:** The Final Word
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
I watched the clearing from the Branching Paths while men carried Myrr away. The place seemed smaller from the outside; the sound of footsteps compressed into tidy data. The bright reason to return was Cassia, but the path brought me to another hand.

Anton Drexler spoke like a man assigning meaning. He treated truth as a policy problem. He said that 'the taint of the past' had to be removed to make room for a future. His logic was simple and cold: sometimes you erase the past to ensure the future.

He ordered me to take a message back to Myrr, phrased the way one sends a condolence letter not meant to comfort. Then he sealed me with an electrostatic stasis field and forced me into a prolonged sleep. The field's telemetry showed a high-energy lock and a timestamp that would later be cited in Core logs.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the exchange clinical and succinct.
- Present Anton's fatalism as a pragmatic ideology rather than an abstract villainy.
- Emphasize Lem's choice to seek truth despite predictable consequences.
