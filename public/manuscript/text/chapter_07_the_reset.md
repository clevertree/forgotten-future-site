# Chapter 7: The Reset

**Title:** The Reset
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
The halls of the chamber were covered in light. Rahu stood in the center. He was made of fire. When Tor attacked him, the fire did not stop. It moved and returned to its original shape. The weapons did not cause any visible damage.

Lynn appeared in her true form and left the body she was using. The energy in the room shifted. She spoke in her own voice. Novak fired a stasis charge. The charge hit Rahu, but he burned through the field and reignited.

Lynn and I moved toward each other. We integrated our power. I am the Wood vessel and she is the Water vessel. For a short time, we were able to stop the fire from moving. We held it in position. Then Lynn left me. She moved into the Capacitor. She did not come back.

Rahu entered the power column. A very bright light appeared. It looked like a second sun. On the Earth below, the electrical grid failed. The city lights went out.

Everything went dark. Novak did not hesitate. She placed us in a containment field. She said we were being kept for study. She called us property. The mission was no longer a rescue.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the merger concise and sensory: avoid spiritualizing beyond Lem's immediate perceptions.
- Focus on the procedural ruthlessness of Novak's decision rather than melodrama.
- Emphasize the physical, visible effects of the Great Fry as immediate sensory facts for Lem.
