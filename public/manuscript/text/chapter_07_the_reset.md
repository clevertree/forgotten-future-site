# Chapter 7: The Reset

Inside the pyramid the air was still as Iris Novak looked around the grand hall. She remained stationary, checking her mission logs without Tor to lead. The plan involved 'healing the temple' from both the inside and the outside before confronting Rahu. She delayed her movements, searching for authorization tapes. Her scans of the area showed no sign of Rahu.

She stood stuck in her own thoughts for a moment while we all waited, until a heavy, rhythmic banging started on the massive sealed door behind us. The sound was so loud it shook the floor and cut through her hesitation, making everyone jump.

The door was torn from its hinges as Tor walked through, his suit burned and metal plates melted together, yet he did not stop. After checking his equipment and looking at the breach, he said, 'Rahu waits in the chamber,' before moving toward the source of the light.

The halls of the chamber were covered in light. Rahu stood in the center, his frame wreathed in a fire that looked like it was made of sharp needles. 

Tor moved with a speed that didn't seem human, his body becoming heavy and solid as if made of earth itself. He struck at Rahu, but his strength was not enough against the piercing heat of Rahu’s fire which cut through his defense. Following a clash that shook the stone, Tor was thrown back, his earth-like shell cracked and glowing from the fire he could not match.

Rahu began to walk toward us. The floor melted beneath his feet. Several soldiers dropped their weapons and moved toward the secondary exits. Iris Novak did not move; she watched the column of light. A soldier standing next to her stepped forward and removed her helmet. it was Lynn. Rahu stopped. His posture shifted; he stepped back from the console. 

They began to talk. They discussed the Core and the requirement for a reset. I did not know then that they were continuing a debate that had lasted for decades; I only recorded the specific frequencies of their voices. Rahu identifying a flaw in Lynn's plan.

Lynn looked at me. "Face in the hole," she said. 

A pressure registered at the base of my skull. It was the same sensation as the merger I later identified as Witch Maya resonance. My skin tightened. My limbs grew. Thick, wooden branches sprouted from my frame.

Rahu struck before the transition was complete. His fire-blade cut the combined body into two distinct pieces. We did not cease to function. The pieces flowed back together. We struck back while Rahu was recovering. 

The contact was total. Our combined mass smothered his flare; I recorded the sound of his metal frame buckling under the pressure of our limbs. His fire went out.

We hit him again. Rahu fell to the stone floor. He was a scorched metal frame. He shook as he tried to raise his arms.

Iris Novak did not hesitate. She used a handheld device to deliver an electrical jolt to Rahu's core. He became immobile. 

Then Lynn separated from me. I recorded a sense of vacancy. I watched her walk into the center of the pyramid toward the energy column. She entered the light. Her form disintegrated into a swirling vortex. 

The reset began.

The world vibrated. The light became too intense for my optical sensors. Novak did not shield her eyes. She watched her tablet. "According to the statistics," she said, her voice steady, "the pyramid is currently the safest place on the moon or the Earth."

Then the second sun was born.
