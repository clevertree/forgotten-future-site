# Chapter 7: The Reset

**Title:** The Reset
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Version:** v0.1-draft
**POV:** Lem

## Draft
Halls of the chamber were scored with light. Rahu stood like a wound that refused to close; when Tor struck, the fire simply rearranged itself. The weapons failed as if they had been written in sand.

Lynn stepped out of the soldier who had worn her, and the room shifted to her measure. She argued with a voice that treated doctrine as a secondary fact. Novak's stasis charge opened and failed—Rahu reignited inside its own net.

In a motion that was less theatrical than inevitable, Lynn and I joined. Wood braided with water and for a thin time the fire became a thing to be held. Then she left in a direction I could not follow; she moved into the Capacitor and became the means to an end.

Rahu chose the column and the result was a light like an answer and a punishment at once. The sky took an extra sun. On Earth the lights went off.

When the world snapped, Novak did not hesitate. She put us in a field to be kept and catalogued; the mission had moved from rescue to property.

## Revision Notes
- Keep the merger concise and sensory: avoid spiritualizing beyond Lem's immediate perceptions.
- Focus on the procedural ruthlessness of Novak's decision rather than melodrama.
- Emphasize the physical, visible effects of the Great Fry as immediate sensory facts for Lem.
