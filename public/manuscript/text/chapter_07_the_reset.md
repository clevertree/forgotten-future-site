# Chapter 7: The Reset

Inside the pyramid, the air was still. Iris Novak looked around the grand hall, her face tight with worry. She was trying to remember the mission orders without Tor there to lead. She knew the plan involved 'healing the temple' from both the inside and the outside before we could even think about confronting Rahu. But she was hesitating. She wasn't sure if she had the right authorization tapes to give those kinds of orders. Part of her thought Rahu was already dead, and without the General around, she felt like she needed to rethink everything. 

She stood there, stuck in her own thoughts, and for a moment, we were all just waiting. Then the sound started. A heavy, rhythmic banging on the massive sealed door behind us. It was so loud it shook the floor and cut right through her hesitation. Every one of us, including me, jumped at the noise.

The door didn't just open; it was torn from its hinges. Tor walked through the opening. His suit was burned and the metal plates were melted together, but he didn't stop. He checked his equipment and looked at the breach. He said: 'Rahu waits in the chamber.' Then he moved toward the source of the light.

The halls of the chamber were covered in light. Rahu stood in the center, his frame wreathed in a fire that looked like it was made of sharp needles. 

Tor didn't wait. He moved with a speed that didn't seem human, his body becoming heavy and solid, like he was made of the earth itself. He struck at Rahu, but even his strength was not enough. Rahu’s fire was different—it was a piercing heat that seemed to cut right through Tor’s defense. There was a clash that shook the stone, and then it was over. Tor was thrown back, his earth-like shell cracked and glowing with the after-effects of the fire. He was no match for it.

Rahu began to walk toward us, his footsteps melting the floor. The soldiers were panicking, their weapons useless, but Iris Novak stood her ground. She looked resolute, almost calm. I didn't understand why until I looked at the soldier standing right next to her.

The soldier stepped forward and removed her helmet. It was Lynn. She didn't look like she had been in a battle; she looked like she was finally where she belonged. Rahu stopped. He looked shocked, even afraid. 

They began to talk, but it wasn't like any conversation I'd ever heard. They had been having this debate for a long time, long before we even arrived on the moon. They disagreed about the Core and what to do with it. Rahu insisted there was a way to defeat the Core without her plan, but Lynn argued that there was no other way. Rahu was the only one who seemed to know what she was really planning to do.

Lynn looked at me. "Face in the hole," she said. 

Before I could ask what she meant, she merged with me. It wasn't a soft feeling; it was like being rewritten. I felt my skin tighten and my limbs grow. I looked down and saw branches—thick, wooden limbs—growing out of our combined form. We looked like a tree that had learned to walk.

Rahu didn't wait for us to finish. He struck, his fire-blade slicing right through the center of our combined body. We were cut into two distinct pieces. But we didn't die. The two pieces flowed back together, recombining in an instant. While Rahu was still recovering from his attack, we struck back. 

We hit him with a force that felt like a tidal wave hitting a bonfire. Even though he tried to slice through us again, our combined strength of wood and water was too much. We hit him hard enough to knock the fire right out of his frame. 

We recombined one last time and struck again, knocking Rahu to the stone floor. His fire went out completely. He was just a scorched metal frame now, shaking as he tried to get up.

Iris Novak didn't hesitate. She didn't shoot to kill; she moved by instinct, following her orders. She used a device to zap Rahu, putting him into a paralysis he couldn't fight. 

Then Lynn did something that surprised everyone. She separated from me, leaving me feeling hollow and exhausted. She walked directly into the center of the pyramid, toward the energy column. As she stepped into the light, she didn't burn; she disintegrated into a swirling energy vortex. 

The reset began.

The world started to shake and the light became blinding. Novak didn't try to shield us. She just looked at her displays. "According to the statistics," she said, her voice steady even as the world ended, "the pyramid is currently the safest place on the moon or the Earth."

Then the second sun was born.
