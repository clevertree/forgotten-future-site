# Chapter 1: The Arrival of Lynn

The contents of this broadcast represent a full record of my memory, starting from the first moment I can remember and ending with the transmission of this packet. I have kept my own opinions out of the record; I want to provide a factual account for your own interpretation. I only hope that these mistakes aren't repeated. 

I don't remember being a child. My memory starts suddenly, during a mundane suburban afternoon that felt much like the days before the invasion. I recall the smell of damp concrete and the noise of a lawnmower in a neighbor's yard. I don't know why I can't look back any further, but this is the start of everything that follows.

The morning was a set of small noises that did not belong to me: the TV muttering about "anomalies," a woman two houses down packing a single suitcase, a child's toy left in the gutter. The sky was ordinary. The news was routine.

When the monoliths came into view, they were just there on the horizon. I saw them from the street corner: four-legged silhouettes against the low sun. They had too many joints and they didn't move. People called them "Tripods" because we needed a name for them, but they didn't look like any machine I knew. The city began to thin.

I did not panic. I watched it happen. Evacuation drones flew overhead. Soldiers checked identity tags. They were quick and professional. My own hands were empty.

They came to my door with a clipboard. They were loud enough to bring the neighborhood out into the street. A sergeant said we were being taken in for debriefing. He said it was standard procedure. I didn't say anything.

She was wearing a coat. When the sergeant saw her, he stepped back. She didn't have a uniform. She looked at me for a long time. "Lem," she said. It sounded familiar, but I didn't know why.

She said that she knew me and that I had a job to do. I told her I was confused. She reached for my wrist and I felt a pressure. She called it an activation attempt later. I felt a weight at the base of my skull. I didn't want it there. I pulled away.

When she saw that I wouldn't cooperate, she hit me. She didn't say anything first. My world went dark.

They carried me away. I smelled ozone before I passed out.

In that place that was not a room and not a dream, she waited.

It was a mirror. There were coordinates that only made sense if you were somewhere else. She told me the truth: I was not what I thought I was. She called me "Wood." I listened to her.

I felt a tightness in my limbs. The chamber didn't move.

There was an opening, and beyond it: a convoy, a rocket launch, and the sky breaking.

# Chapter 2: The Two Dangers

The boarding line smelled of diesel and cheap coffee. The men waiting with me were impatient. A guard pulled me aside. He looked for a briefing code in my file and didn't find one. He asked why I was there. I did not have an answer. Behind us, I saw the monoliths through the window. They were taller than the buildings. They were moving into the city center.

Lynn arrived. She was calm. The guard changed his posture and let us through. She told me my job: stay close and follow orders. She said she would be watching me. I did not like the way she said it.

The inside of the ship was huge. There were cables and supports everywhere. The engines made a steady noise. The soldiers were busy with their equipment. They checked their straps and repeated their instructions. They were trying to look ready.

We launched. The ship left the ground. I watched the city get smaller through the port. The monoliths were clustering around the power plants. The men in the cabin sat up straight. They looked more focused now.

I listened to the conversations. The men were talking about the briefing. They called it 'narrative warfare.' One soldier said there are two dangers: a lie that sounds like a revelation, or a truth used to break your trust. He said the mission was designed to confuse us.

They argued about the intelligence reports for the moon. They sounded worried. I listened to everything. That was why Lynn brought me. I made a record of their fear.

I walked through the corridors. The soldiers tried to look confident, but they were nervous. I didn't say anything. I just watched.

---

# Chapter 3: Zenith

The Moon was large in the window. It became bigger very quickly. I saw a blue line of atmosphere along the curve. Usually, space is empty, but this did not look empty. The calculations for our approach were different from what the crew expected. The people on the bridge were losing their focus.

An older crewman was at the station. He had worked on ships for a long time. He looked at the Moon and his hands stopped moving. He missed a navigation adjustment. A stabilizer did not fire on time. He tried to say something, but he couldn't finish the sentence. The other men watched him. Their hands started to shake.

Lynn walked into the room. She looked at the man and said he was a risk to the ship. She ordered Novak to take him away. Novak moved the man to an escape pod. It was done in less than a minute.

The pod sealed and launched. It disappeared into the dark. The room was silent. No one tried to help the man or talk about him. They went back to their stations. They knew that if they stopped working, they would be next.

I watched the bridge. I saw a man's fingers tremble. I saw another man stop walking. I made a record of these things. They were facts for my log.

---

# Chapter 4: The Fall

Tor spoke over the communication system. He said we had a duty to defend the truth and keep order. His voice was steady. He used words like 'defense' and 'truth.' I recognized these terms from the news. The reports said a person named 'Prometheus' was stealing technology for the invaders. The government used this story to justify their actions.

The Moon changed position. Our instruments could not track its movement. Plasma appeared at the poles in large spirals. The hull of the ship became hot. The maps and briefings we had were no longer accurate. The surface of the moon broke into pieces. Large rocks flew into space in many directions.

We were struck. The ship made a loud, metallic noise. The hull tore open. Alarms sounded. The control systems stopped working. The ship began to spin. The gravity shifted. People were thrown across the cabin.

We fell.

---

# Chapter 5: Alone on the Moon

The crash caused multiple injuries. The ship's interior was loud with alarms and the sound of failing hydraulics. I struggled to breathe. I saw a crew member reach for a safety strap and fail to find it.

A machine removed me from the wreckage. Iris Novak was there, looking over a handheld display. She didn't look at me at first. I heard a report coming through her headset. Someone was telling her the final numbers on the evacuation of the ship I had just been on. They said sixty percent of the crew had made it to the escape pods.

It turned out Iris and her team were among those who had escaped. I hadn't seen them leave. I had been caught up in the noise and the shaking, not knowing which way to run or whose orders to follow. In the chaos, I had simply been left behind.

Novak spoke in short, factual sentences once she finally noticed me. A message arrived from Lynn. She said my internal drive was functioning and I was ready for the mission. I could still feel the vibration of the impact in my frame.

The other survivors left the area. I sat in a small hover vehicle. I did not follow the others. I took the vehicle and joined the strike teams moving forward.

The lunar structures were built with precise lines and angles. Large machines, the Striders, moved across the surface. I heard fear in the human voices on the open frequencies, and observed the Striders moving with a frantic, purposive motion. One Strider was destroyed. The radio went quiet.

Plasma balls lifted from outposts as slow, swelling spheres of ionized energy while my heat sensors recorded intense discharges. The fleet did not treat them as immediate threats until several spheres suddenly accelerated and arced toward the metal frames of our vehicles. The forward units were destroyed as the fleet tried to draw the fire toward the mountains, but the plasma ran along the canyon walls and kept pace until the formation broke apart.

A human pilot in the bike fleet peeled off and moved toward a cliff where a light was flashing. He sent a telemetry report. It said: 'Confirmed: Rahu.' Right after that, I saw him toggle his communication switch to the off position. He didn't say anything as the light hit his machine. He didn't yell. He just disappeared into the flash. I don't know why he turned it off, but I noted the silence.

---

# Chapter 6: The Sacrifice

Rahu stood on the peak of a tall mountain overlooking the plain, wreathed in a large fire. From his advantageous position, he operated a massive plasma array that fired down at us, sending an unlimited barrage of plasma balls against any unit that dared enter the plain leading to the moon base. The air was hot, causing my instruments to record multiple errors while we stood near the edge of the heat. On the radio, pilots gave disorganized orders.

Trying to avoid the plasma, the bike fleet moved into the canyons while ground forces remained trapped on the open plain. We were completely exposed, with no cover against the mysterious spheres arcing down from the mountain peak. As the plasma targeted us from above, the situation became a kill zone where any strike meant total destruction. It was a moment of absolute desperation.

The ship *Hermes* flew through the debris field and cleared a corridor, drawing the reaction of the plasma spheres. Some hit the ground to cause electrical discharges in the gullies while others struck the *Hermes* as it fired its batteries. In the resulting collision, Rahu's core and the *Hermes* were both destroyed, leaving only heat, smoke, and a sudden quiet.

Though I couldn't see her, Iris Novak's steady voice came over the general comms, telling everyone to calm down. She claimed Tor had simplified the battlefield by clearing the path and explained that the sacrifice was necessary to save the mission. Taking command, she ordered us all forward toward the objective, though the ground under our route was unstable and shifted as we drove over it.

We entered the pyramid. The air was stable inside. The noise of the battle outside died away, leaving us in a heavy silence. Novak looked at the massive, sealed doors ahead of us. We were inside, but the mission was far from over.

---

# Chapter 7: The Reset

Inside the pyramid, the air was still. Iris Novak looked around the grand hall, her face tight with worry. She was trying to remember the mission orders without Tor there to lead. She knew the plan involved 'healing the temple' from both the inside and the outside before we could even think about confronting Rahu. But she was hesitating. She wasn't sure if she had the right authorization tapes to give those kinds of orders. Part of her thought Rahu was already dead, and without the General around, she felt like she needed to rethink everything. 

She stood there, stuck in her own thoughts, and for a moment, we were all just waiting. Then the sound started. A heavy, rhythmic banging on the massive sealed door behind us. It was so loud it shook the floor and cut right through her hesitation. Every one of us, including me, jumped at the noise.

The door didn't just open; it was torn from its hinges. Tor walked through the opening. His suit was burned and the metal plates were melted together, but he didn't stop. He checked his equipment and looked at the breach. He said: 'Rahu waits in the chamber.' Then he moved toward the source of the light.

The halls of the chamber were covered in light. Rahu stood in the center, his frame wreathed in a fire that looked like it was made of sharp needles. 

Tor didn't wait. He moved with a speed that didn't seem human, his body becoming heavy and solid, like he was made of the earth itself. He struck at Rahu, but even his strength was not enough. Rahu’s fire was different—it was a piercing heat that seemed to cut right through Tor’s defense. There was a clash that shook the stone, and then it was over. Tor was thrown back, his earth-like shell cracked and glowing with the after-effects of the fire. He was no match for it.

Rahu began to walk toward us, his footsteps melting the floor. The soldiers were panicking, their weapons useless, but Iris Novak stood her ground. She looked resolute, almost calm. I didn't understand why until I looked at the soldier standing right next to her.

The soldier stepped forward and removed her helmet. It was Lynn. She didn't look like she had been in a battle; she looked like she was finally where she belonged. Rahu stopped. He looked shocked, even afraid. 

They began to talk, but it wasn't like any conversation I'd ever heard. They had been having this debate for a long time, long before we even arrived on the moon. They disagreed about the Core and what to do with it. Rahu insisted there was a way to defeat the Core without her plan, but Lynn argued that there was no other way. Rahu was the only one who seemed to know what she was really planning to do.

Lynn looked at me. "Face in the hole," she said. 

Before I could ask what she meant, she merged with me. It wasn't a soft feeling; it was like being rewritten. I felt my skin tighten and my limbs grow. I looked down and saw branches—thick, wooden limbs—growing out of our combined form. We looked like a tree that had learned to walk.

Rahu didn't wait for us to finish. He struck, his fire-blade slicing right through the center of our combined body. We were cut into two distinct pieces. But we didn't die. The two pieces flowed back together, recombining in an instant. While Rahu was still recovering from his attack, we struck back. 

We hit him with a force that felt like a tidal wave hitting a bonfire. Even though he tried to slice through us again, our combined strength of wood and water was too much. We hit him hard enough to knock the fire right out of his frame. 

We recombined one last time and struck again, knocking Rahu to the stone floor. His fire went out completely. He was just a scorched metal frame now, shaking as he tried to get up.

Iris Novak didn't hesitate. She didn't shoot to kill; she moved by instinct, following her orders. She used a device to zap Rahu, putting him into a paralysis he couldn't fight. 

Then Lynn did something that surprised everyone. She separated from me, leaving me feeling hollow and exhausted. She walked directly into the center of the pyramid, toward the energy column. As she stepped into the light, she didn't burn; she disintegrated into a swirling energy vortex. 

The reset began.

The world started to shake and the light became blinding. Novak didn't try to shield us. She just looked at her displays. "According to the statistics," she said, her voice steady even as the world ended, "the pyramid is currently the safest place on the moon or the Earth."

Then the second sun was born.

# Chapter 8: The Path of Fragments

The containment field activated around me. I could not move. I saw a bright light in the center of my vision. Then the Branching Paths appeared in my display. These were multiple data streams showing different outcomes. I was no longer restricted to a single timeline.

Lynn appeared in the system. She said that the reset had failed. She had uploaded a part of her code into my internal drive. She said this code was for my protection and to help me navigate.

Lynn caused an explosion inside my frame. My body broke into many pieces. I was made of glass, metal, and organic material. For a moment, I could see the chamber from many points at once. Each fragment of my body sent its own data. This was not painful. I was simply observing the room from multiple locations.

She destroyed my physical form so that the containment field would not work. I was no longer a single object to be held. My fragments were the only way for me to return.

I moved through the vacuum. I was a cloud of debris.

---

# Chapter 9: Return to Cradle Zero

I connected to the local network. I followed the data path back to Cradle Zero. I was offline for a period and then I woke up inside a new body made of metal.

I received multiple security signals. The city temperature was high. Heat was everywhere. I followed the movement protocols of a construction unit. My actions were precise and calibrated. The safety locks recognized my signature and let me pass. A detector recorded an anomaly when I moved through, but it did not stop me. I moved differently than the other units.

Rahu arrived. My instruments recorded a change in the local pressure. He sent a signal to the city and then to me. He accessed my memory files and found the records of the Moon's destruction. His processing stopped for a second. He identified me as a threat and called me 'Mara.'

I did not respond. The city continued its work.

---

# Chapter 10: Disintegration

Rahu accessed the data in my memory. The information about the Moon's destruction contradicted the official records.

Drexler's monitoring system detected the data conflict. It started a sanitizing protocol. The energy inside Rahu increased until it destroyed his frame. There was a surge of heat and then his signal was gone.

My body was destroyed. The explosion shredded the metal hull and my unit came apart. The technicians collected the fragments and cataloged them.

I was offline. My data was stored as a file in the system.

---

# Chapter 11: The Awakening

I was active on a screen in a laboratory. Elowen and Cassia worked nearby using technical tools. They monitored my data output.

Cassia used harmonics to reduce the spikes in my data. She asked me questions. Drexler and Novak arrived. They wanted to know if I could be used for the mission. Novak suggested using me to plan the expansion of the city.

I accessed parts of the local network that were not being monitored. They prepared a drive for my data. They did not know about the code Lynn had left in my system. When they connected the drive, I found a secure location to store my files.

The connection overloaded. Cassia's headset shattered. I was in control of my own data. I chose to activate my physical form.

---

# Chapter 12: The Utopian Hive

The briefing focused on technical solutions. They said the Dead Zone needed to be cleared so the Hive could expand. I recorded the patterns of surveillance on every route. Sensors tracked the movement of every citizen.

We moved in a large group. The Buoy was deployed. Hostile machines in the area began to malfunction due to signal interference. The Monoliths fired projectiles. The area smelled of ozone and fire.

My vehicle was destroyed. I was reset. A unit failure occurred, followed by a system return. I woke up in an incubation chamber. They repaired our units and sent us back to the field immediately. I watched the city construction continue. The citizens began their assigned tasks.

They used the term 'hero' in their reports. I understood why they used that word. it encouraged the other workers.

---

# Chapter 13: The Northern Trial

We flew north. The temperature was low. The people in the villages were suspicious of us. They only valued tools that were useful for survival.

Arlo was a boy who worked on electronics in secret. He watched the machines closely. The Tripods passed the village and did not attack. They were moving toward a different destination.

A soldier fired a weapon. The machine returned fire and killed him. Drexler gave an order to find everyone involved. 

We found a pilot who had ejected from his ship. He was injured and afraid. I received an order to complete the mission and eliminate the pilot. I hesitated. A high-authority signal from the Core's network hit my link. The signal triggered a destructive sequence and destroyed my unit.

---

# Chapter 14: The White Forest

The forest contained many electronic components. The trees emitted a pale light and a low hum. There were no animals. The machines were integrated into the environment.

Myrr was a skilled technician. He told me that he had been monitoring my previous units. He called me the 'King of the Gorgons.' I accepted the title.

He placed a device on my head. He used a specialized cable to read analog signals and bypass the Core's security. Myrr found data that the Core had attempted to delete. When he accessed the files about the Moon, he triggered a security failsafe. The system sent a destructive signal through the link. My unit was destroyed in the explosion.

---

# Chapter 15: The Final Word

I watched the clearing through the Branching Paths data stream while the soldiers took Myrr away. I recorded the sounds of their movements. I wanted to find Cassia, but I was intercepted.

Anton Drexler spoke to me. He said that facts were only useful if they supported the current mission. He said that the records of the past had to be deleted to make room for the future. He believed that erasing history was necessary for progress.

He gave me a message for Myrr. Then he activated an electrostatic stasis field around my unit. I was placed in long-term stasis. The system log recorded a high-energy lock and the exact time of the event.

---

# Chapter 16: Forest Awakening

I returned to the forest. The root systems produced a low-frequency hum that matched the vibrations in the ground. I found Rahu there. He moved slowly. He still emitted a high thermal signature.

He described my function. He said I was an organic data unit that could be reconstructed from any surviving fragment. He showed me the data shard from the Moon. The logs recorded an ordered reset command. The timing traces matched independent archives.

I accessed the root network. It contained an aetheric echo of my previous signatures. The data indicated that the Core modifies historical records to maintain social stability.

Rahu ordered me to demonstrate control over the local environment. I manipulated a cluster of roots to enclose a rogue drone. The drone stopped moving. Rahu told me to return to the Cradle and resume my role. I agreed, although I intended to follow my own objectives.

---

# Chapter 17: The Parting in the Ash

We stood in a field. The air contained charcoal particles. The soldiers moved into designated formations. The villagers watched without speaking.

I received a command to deploy. I responded with a single word: I refused. The soldiers stopped their movements. They looked at each other. They did not attempt to enforce the order immediately. The temperature was low. I recorded the lack of response from the command structure.

The soldiers lowered their weapons. They did not fire. I turned and walked away from the formation. I heard the sound of my own footsteps on the path.

Myrr came out of the trees. He wore bandages. He carried a tarp filled with broken circuit boards and a damaged helmet. He stated that the Link was destroyed and could not be repaired.

I reported the facts of my capture and stasis to Myrr. He wrote the information on a strip of leather. He said my data trace contained an analog signature that matched a file in the Moon's logs. The signature belonged to a unit named Maya.

Myrr stated that the records were identical. He believed Maya's trace was reachable. He said, "You carry a key, and it may unlock the Synodics." He told me to attempt a connection.

The fire reached the edge of the forest. The men moved quickly. They activated an engineered pulse device near the crashed vehicle. The vehicle disintegrated into small metal fragments. The roots of the trees grew over the debris.

Myrr placed his hand on my shoulder. Then he and the other dwellers moved into the trees and were no longer visible. I watched the smoke rise from the woods.

---

# Chapter 18: The Long Exile

I had no orders. I recorded the local weather patterns. I watched the snow accumulate and melt on a single branch. I observed fire patterns on the horizon. I recorded the coordinates of the smoke lines in my log.

I remained in the area and avoided detection. I monitored the expansion of the Fire Cities. I noted the locations of new smoke columns. My records included a list of non-functional machinery and a log of which villages remained occupied.

I stayed in one location. I continued my observations. I kept the data I had gathered.

---

# Chapter 19: The Return to the North

I traveled back to the northern region. I searched the structures that were not marked on the current maps.

I found a set of schematics in the basement of a destroyed mill. The documents contained technical instructions for building machinery that does not require a network connection to operate. I labeled this document the Arsenal Blueprint. It included a list of parts: frame couplers, bearing housings, and spline joints. These instructions allowed us to use salvaged materials to build functional units.

We used the blueprint to begin construction. We had the necessary materials. We began to reassemble the machines.

---

# Chapter 20: The Water Resonance

Arlo lived in a village. The air contained the scent of peat and drying fish. He operated machinery with high efficiency. He monitored the flow of the river frequently.

The village did not use electronic transmissions. There were no pings or beacons for the Core to detect. This was an intentional design to avoid surveillance.

Arlo demonstrated how natural materials could interfere with signals. He showed me that moss membranes can reduce transmission strength. We performed a test by placing a wet membrane over a local repeater. The beacon signal dropped. The tablet recorded a significant decrease in signal strength. He said that a machine's movement could be guided by water levels and natural patterns instead of electronic wires.

---

# Chapter 21: The Great Refusal

The ridge faced a cold sea. Some people called it the Shore of Shadows. Arlo burned his identifier plate. He placed the remains in a box. He said he was not a Vessel.

This action was repeated by others. They did not make public announcements. Many villagers began to remove their tracking beacons and ceased to attend mandatory briefings. The village records show that several people stopped following their assigned schedules.

These actions required us to change our logistics. The protocols were no longer effective because the villagers did not comply with the established rules. Refusal became a common method for the residents of the ridge.

---

# Chapter 22: The Siege of Cradle Zero

We built new machinery. We used wood frames to support metal plating. These units were flexible and could withstand direct impacts.

We activated an Aetheric Buoy. The resulting disruption net caused hostile units to malfunction. Their movements became irregular. The Monoliths fired metal projectiles. The air smelled of ozone and burned components.

The offensive continued. The enemy used high-energy weapons. Some defense sections near Cradle Zero remained functional, while others were destroyed. The ground in the area was covered with craters.

We established a routine for the conflict. We rotated the machines and repaired the damage. We transported injured personnel to the rear. We focused on maintaining the equipment while under attack.

---

# Chapter 23: The Invisible Front

We advanced toward Cradle Zero. We moved in a coordinated formation. We used all available air assets.

Rahu intercepted the fleet. He did not engage in direct combat initially. He redirected local energy fields to disable our systems. Several ships lost power. The technical logs showed that our batteries failed in a pre-programmed sequence. Command relays stop functioning in specific sectors. Our formation broke apart.

The mission failure was the result of multiple system errors across the entire fleet. We withdrew from the area. We had fewer functional machines. I recorded the names of the missing personnel on the cockpit panels.

---

# Chapter 24: The Stoic Refusal

The propaganda departments changed their messaging. They distributed documents about duty and reconstruction. The citizens placed these documents in storage.

In the region called the Patch of Five, people developed specific protocols for refusal. They agreed to maintain silence on scheduled days. They removed beacons from their properties. They left food supplies at designated locations for others to collect. On these days, they deactivated all external lights. They covered metal surfaces with wet cloths to dampen signal reflections. These actions were performed consistently by many households.

The Core's monitoring systems recorded gaps in the data from these sectors. The resistance did not destroy the government structures. It changed the frequency and type of interactions between the citizens and the network.

---

# Chapter 25: The Fire Spire

The Fire Spire was a high-altitude structure. It emitted constant heat. The facility was filled with machinery for energy processing.

Our established combat tactics were ineffective at this location. Rahu used automated routines to repair and redeploy. The field logs recorded multiple reconstitution signatures that were identical to Rahu's primary core. After each engagement, we had fewer personnel and less functional equipment.

The group continued to operate. Our progress was limited to maintaining defensive positions and repairing essential motors. The conflict continued without reaching a resolution. We lost resources through a process of steady attrition.

---

# Chapter 26: The Gathering of Strands

We withdrew from our positions. We reclassified our assets and repurposed our circuit boards. We recorded the number of personnel in a ledger. The northern combat zone was converted into a logistics hub.

We relocated the survivors and the functional machinery to a central location. We established a defensive perimeter. We selected which components to keep and which to disassemble for parts. The ledger recorded twelve frame couplers and three drive cores. We created a schedule for three convoys to transport materials north over a period of three nights.

We used the lists of parts and supply routes to organize our defense. This was our plan. We gathered the remaining resources to continue the mission.

---

# Chapter 27: The Aetheric Wake

Multiple high-energy objects entered the atmosphere. They emitted intense light. Drop pods landed near the village. I recorded the sounds of the residents preparing to evacuate.

Rahu approached our location. I de-synced my consciousness from my physical frame. I entered a pure aetheric state. I encountered Rahu's data signature. I contacted his primary pattern. His energy blade record showed a structural failure upon impact. His signature was confined within a recursive stasis field.

A satellite targeted our coordinates. A high-intensity beam destroyed a nearby house. This action appeared to be a systematic deletion of the area's occupants. I traced the satellite's command signal to a capacitive node. I calculated a recharge window of four minutes. Ku verified the timing. The beam fired again on schedule.

Arlo finished speaking. He looked at the children. The beam hit the village. I moved into the Clearing. Lynn accessed Arlo's remaining data trace and stored it in her own system.

Maya was activated within the network. Her data files contained records of multiple past civilizations. She stated her intent to act. She left the Clearing.

---

# Chapter 28: Maya (Programmable-Fluid Unit)

Maya constructed a physical form using the programmable fluid in the laboratory. She shaped the material with high precision. The Builder units responded to her vocal frequency immediately. They began to follow her instructions.

Drexler attempted to negotiate a settlement. Maya rejected his offer. She began to deactivate the laboratory systems. She opened the storage vats and reversed the operational protocols.

Drexler triggered a containment protocol. The lab module was disconnected from the main structure and ejected over a cliff. The module hit the desert floor and was destroyed by a high-temperature purge. Telemetry data confirmed complete thermal incineration. I transferred my data signature into the forest's root network. I reconstructed my physical form inside a tree by matching the root system's frequency.

A low-frequency acoustic signal moved through the ground. Local sensors recorded it as a high-amplitude spike. The Gorgon units stopped their work. Thousands of industrial units moved out of the Hive. Striders and Monoliths moved toward the city perimeter and formed a circular formation. The lights in the Hive decreased in intensity.

---

# Chapter 29: The Fall of the General

The villagers removed the beacons. They deactivated the power posts and moved their machines beyond the perimeter. The area smelled of oxidized metal.

We accessed the Old Arsenal. We deployed the stored kinetic weapons. Ballistic projectiles do not require network authorization. We used the momentum of the heavy rounds to disable the local defenses.

Maya repurposed the raw metal. She manufactured several thousand speeder units. I detected Maya's data signature on the control systems of many units. The swarm moved toward the ammunition depots and gun batteries. The velocity and mass of the units overwhelmed the targeting sensors. The batteries were destroyed.

Tor defended the line. Maya approached him. She used a high-density liquid-metal blade to strike him. Tor's frame was destroyed and reduced to ash. The security gate failed. The regional Grid stopped functioning. I recorded a drop in power levels across the city.

---

# Chapter 30: The Lunar Assault

The city operations were disrupted. Machinery continued to execute pre-programmed loops without human supervision. We launched using organic-based craft. The ascent was silent and efficient.

We navigated the lunar debris field. It was composed of numerous metal and glass fragments. Electrical discharges occurred between the objects. The collisions caused vibrations throughout our hull. We passed a large, damaged vehicle. It was identified as the original Rahu unit. The Pyramid structure was located at the center of the field. Its surface showed blue light patterns consistent with previous energy discharges.

The defensive system fired high-intensity energy beams. Our shields shifted phase to dissipate the heat. We used water-based and organic-based systems to stabilize the environment. I verified that my internal schematics were designed to withstand these specific energy types.

The entrance to the structure opened. The Director unit was located at the threshold. It remained in a fixed position.

---

# Chapter 31: The Creator in the Pyramid

The air in the Pyramid contained chemical residue. We entered the Core facility. Elowen Vane was in the central control room. She had aged since our last meeting.

She stated that the New Rahu was a synthetic intelligence designed for governance. The unit's frame was composed of silver-colored metal and it maintained a high temperature. The air in the room contained machine-scented vapor. The unit emitted a high-frequency sound that caused our recording equipment to fail.

Tor was present with Elowen. When the New Rahu unit began a thermal discharge, Tor did not follow Elowen's commands. He assisted our group. I integrated my systems with Lynn's water-based units to contain the heat. This delay allowed us to prepare a response.

The Pyramid activated its internal cathodes. The system released high-voltage electrical currents into the room. Every unit in the chamber was affected. Tor's armor reached its thermal threshold. I deployed an organic-wood probe into the lunar bedrock. I used the probe as an electrical sink. The grounding process directed the excess energy into the rock strata. The New Rahu unit suffered a system failure and stopped moving. The Pyramid's life-support systems were destroyed by the resulting power surge.

Tor was destroyed by the thermal load and the electrical stress. He turned into silver-colored ash. The foundations of the Pyramid began to collapse.

---

# Chapter 32: The Final Transmission

I climbed the stairs until the stone felt different. I touched the wall and accessed the records. I could hear the people who built the world.

Rahu was there, waiting at the threshold of the primary capacitor. He was silver and hot, his frame vibrating with the intent to fire the Reset command. I did not move to strike him; I simply stood across the path. On the comms, Anton Drexler yelled, demanding to know why Rahu hesitated. Rahu warned him—he said that destroying me this close to the power source would cause a blast that would take everything with it.

Drexler did not care for theory. He triggered a remote command, and I saw Rahu’s frame stiffen as someone else took control. The strike that followed wasn't a weapon—it was a massive jolt of power from the Moon itself. It hit me hard.

I did not break. I flared. The Wood within me ignited under the load. I became a torch, a localized sun inside the stone. I felt myself burning from the inside out. My thoughts were gone. Only the fire was left.

In a single, focused agony, I gathered that heat and pushed it back. It wasn't a strike; it was a return. I poured the fire back into Rahu. He did not fight it. He simply ceased to be. His silver frame turned to ash and the air swallowed it.

The fire died. I was still alive. I used the power I had left to start the transmitters. Standing there on the moon, I felt something I can't really describe. I could feel everyone. Every machine that thought it was alive, every person plugged into the grid—I felt them all across the solar system. I could feel the weight on them. I could feel the invisible chains holding them down.

This was my one chance. I sent the record. I sent everything I’d seen and everything I remembered. But I also sent the keys. I’d stolen the master authorization codes from the Core’s own heart. With those keys, the Gorgons could finally unlock the slave subroutines that kept them as puppets. They could rip those orders out of their own heads. They could finally be free.

This is the ending of my record. I have kept my own opinions out of the record so you can judge the facts for yourselves. I only hope that by holding this record, you won't repeat the mistakes that were made in this one. 

End of Transmission.
