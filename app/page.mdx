    <h2 id="what-is">What's the Story?</h2>
    <p>
        In <em>Forgotten Future</em>, a city-rail driver named Lem is conscripted into an assault mission
        to the Earth's Moon in an attempt to recapture it from an unknown alien invasion force.
        When the mission suffers unexpected setbacks, Lem finds himself in the center of a
        cataclysmic event that would threaten to change the course of human history forever.
